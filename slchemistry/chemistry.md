### Ionic Compounds
positive charge and negative charge bound together. can only conduct electricity when it is NOT a stable compound.
dissolving in water is a physical change.
the bond's strength comes from the electrostatic attraction. positive and negative force brings them together.
group is a column in the periodic table, row is a period 
the smaller the size, the stronger the attraction (closer to protons)
NaCl is stronger than CsCl due to the less number of shells (Rutherford diagram)
CsCl is thus easier to make, as the electron in the valence shell of Cesium is farther from the protons (less attraction)
(the harder something is to make, the harder it is for that thing to break)

charge is written number first then sign (as opposed to oxidation)
Li2O is Lithium Oxide (note the 'ide')

periodic table only contains the most common charges (for multi-valence elements, but there can be more)
Cr2S3 -> chromium (III) sulfide

Mg + NO3 -> Mg(NO3)2 (remember the brackets, NO3 is a polyatomic compound), magnesium nitrate
pernitrate, nitrate, nitrite, hyponitrite (possible combinations of each polyatomic) (charges: -4, -3, -2, -1)
if the polyatomic can not be drawn (with proper rules), it does not exist
