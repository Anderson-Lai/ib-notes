## Ionic Compounds  
positive charge and negative charge bound together. can only conduct electricity when it is NOT a stable compound.  
dissolving in water is a physical change.  
the bond's strength comes from the electrostatic attraction. positive and negative force brings them together.  
group is a column in the periodic table, row is a period   
the smaller the size, the stronger the attraction (closer to protons)  
NaCl is stronger than CsCl due to the less number of shells (Rutherford diagram)  
CsCl is thus easier to make, as the electron in the valence shell of Cesium is farther from the protons (less attraction)  
(the harder something is to make, the harder it is for that thing to break)  
  
charge is written number first then sign (as opposed to oxidation)  
Li2O is Lithium Oxide (note the 'ide')  
  
periodic table only contains the most common charges (for multi-valence elements, but there can be more)  
Cr2S3 -> chromium (III) sulfide  
  
Mg + NO3 -> Mg(NO3)2 (remember the brackets, NO3 is a polyatomic compound), magnesium nitrate  
pernitrate, nitrate, nitrite, hyponitrite (possible combinations of each polyatomic) (charges: -4, -3, -2, -1)  
if the polyatomic can not be drawn (with proper rules), it does not exist  
  
recall: hydrogen is a non-metal, thus water is a covalent compound (albeit it is one of the stronger covalent compounds)  
normal (distilled) water has a density of 1   
  
in lattice structures - smaller is normally the metal, larger is non-metal  
H2O is stating the RATIO of elements  
the more compacted the elements are into the lattice structure, the stronger the structure  
(this concept can be used an idea to prove strength of bonds)  
dissolving a structure (compound) in water can be used to test its strength  
the more that can dissolve, the weaker the structure  
there is no real trend with melting point  
the melting point influences the strength of a structure, but it will fluctuate and certain stronger elements will have a lower melting point,   
even when structures should be getting stronger (there are other factors that influence the strength of structures)  
  
### A single blanket statement can not be made for groups of elements  
  
# Sept. 5, 2024 - Lattice Enthalpy

## Lattice Enthalpy
the harder a compound is to make, the harder it is for it to break apart  
lattice energy - the amount of energy needed to break apart the electrostatic attraction  
the more electrons given, the stronger the bond  
electrons move one at a time, after first electron leaves, the attractional force becomes stronger for the element losing electrons  
the element gaining electrons also gains a negative charge, making the incoming electron more repelled and more difficult to be absorbed  

## Aqueous Solutions
in a higher energy state than a solid, and thus are easier to make react  
water is a solvent in this case  
salt would be a solute  

energy is always moving, a solid being dissolved is also always being reformed; however, it is being dissolved
at such a speed where it is not visible  

# Sept. 9, 2024 - Covalent Compounds

## Covalent Structures
criss-cross method still remains  
remember to add prefixes (-ide suffix still exists)  
sign of the charges in these structures does not matter  
there is no electrostatic attraction  

reduction subscripts can occur (they share electrons in many different ways) (will not show all possible formations of said compound though)
they need space to share the electrons (lewis structures need to be drawn)  

electrons by themself in a lewis structure are not happy (if any are left, said compound can not exist)  
this should be used to determine if a compound exists, not reducing subscripts  
either 2, 4, or 6 electrons can be shared  
all elements (except hydrogen) should have 8 valence electrons  

one oxygen can not share to two carbons (just does not exist in chemistry)  
if such structure (like a triangle) exists in your drawing, that compound does not exist  
'cycles' do not exist either (an oxygen reaching across a carbon to another oxygen won't exist)  
an atom should only be one side of another atom (O - C - O)

# Sept. 10, 2024 - Lewis Structures

## Coordinate Bonds
an already bonded group of 2 electrons (say in nitrogen), shares its pair of two electrons with another element  
only exists for period 2 nonmetals  
for subsequent periods, the valence electrons are farther away, and the sharing can be substituted for something else  
a full lone pair is being shared (very, very weak bond)  

only kick out electrons for elements that are "unhappy"  
difficult to kick out electrons for "happy" elements  
contrary to ionic compounds, harder to make != harder to break, rather, it makes the covalent compound harder to form  

all atoms at the end of the drawing must have 8 total electrons, or else the compound does not exist  
oxygen can not bind with another oxygen ever  
a polyatomic must have the same charge across different 'variants' for it to be considered the same polyatomic  

NO4 (1-) - pernitrate (does not exist)  
NO3 (1-) - nitrate  
NO2 (1-) - nitrite  
NO (1-) - hyponitrite - possible, however, you do not to add the extra charge on the 'central' atom (like a metal in an ionic compound)  
(the charge is added to the nitrogen)  
if the charge were to put on the oxygen, a lot more bonding has to happen, making it much more unlikely to be formed than with the result with the extra electron added to the nitrogen  

however, even with the added charge on the central nitrogen atom, the structure is still unlikely to form (due to the extra charge on a central atom)  

**All covalent compounds follow the octet rule**  
Exceptions:   
- Hydrogen must only have 2 electrons  
- Incomplete octet (take BCl3)  

the most imoprtant factor is that  all existing valence electrons are paired up  
since boron had 3 valence electrons, there only being 6 total electrson in the valence shell means it is still satisfied  
the 3 chlorine share their electrons to make the 3 valence electrons of boron paired, thus making boron 'satisfied'  

**Goal number 1: pair single electrons**

- Expanded octet  

for period 3-7 atoms:  
separate lone pairs to make more bonds (SO4 2-)  
satisfied pairs are 'broken apart' into 2 separate electrons to make more bonds  
sulfur ends up having 12 valence electrons, which, since its valence shell is farther from the nucleus, is possible
