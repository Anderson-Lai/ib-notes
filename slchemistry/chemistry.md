## Ionic Compounds  
positive charge and negative charge bound together. can only conduct electricity when it is NOT a stable compound.  
dissolving in water is a physical change.  
the bond's strength comes from the electrostatic attraction. positive and negative force brings them together.  
group is a column in the periodic table, row is a period   
the smaller the size, the stronger the attraction (closer to protons)  
NaCl is stronger than CsCl due to the less number of shells (Rutherford diagram)  
CsCl is thus easier to make, as the electron in the valence shell of Cesium is farther from the protons (less attraction)  
(the harder something is to make, the harder it is for that thing to break)  
  
charge is written number first then sign (as opposed to oxidation)  
Li2O is Lithium Oxide (note the 'ide')  
  
periodic table only contains the most common charges (for multi-valence elements, but there can be more)  
Cr2S3 -> chromium (III) sulfide  
  
Mg + NO3 -> Mg(NO3)2 (remember the brackets, NO3 is a polyatomic compound), magnesium nitrate  
pernitrate, nitrate, nitrite, hyponitrite (possible combinations of each polyatomic) (charges: -4, -3, -2, -1)  
if the polyatomic can not be drawn (with proper rules), it does not exist  
  
recall: hydrogen is a non-metal, thus water is a covalent compound (albeit it is one of the stronger covalent compounds)  
normal (distilled) water has a density of 1   
  
in lattice structures - smaller is normally the metal, larger is non-metal  
H2O is stating the RATIO of elements  
the more compacted the elements are into the lattice structure, the stronger the structure  
(this concept can be used an idea to prove strength of bonds)  
dissolving a structure (compound) in water can be used to test its strength  
the more that can dissolve, the weaker the structure  
there is no real trend with melting point  
the melting point influences the strength of a structure, but it will fluctuate and certain stronger elements will have a lower melting point,   
even when structures should be getting stronger (there are other factors that influence the strength of structures)  
  
### A single blanket statement can not be made for groups of elements  
  
# Sept. 5, 2024 - Lattice Enthalpy

## Lattice Enthalpy
the harder a compound is to make, the harder it is for it to break apart  
lattice energy - the amount of energy needed to break apart the electrostatic attraction  
the more electrons given, the stronger the bond  
electrons move one at a time, after first electron leaves, the attractional force becomes stronger for the element losing electrons  
the element gaining electrons also gains a negative charge, making the incoming electron more repelled and more difficult to be absorbed  

## Aqueous Solutions
in a higher energy state than a solid, and thus are easier to make react  
water is a solvent in this case  
salt would be a solute  

energy is always moving, a solid being dissolved is also always being reformed; however, it is being dissolved
at such a speed where it is not visible  

# Sept. 9, 2024 - Covalent Compounds

## Covalent Structures
criss-cross method still remains  
remember to add prefixes (-ide suffix still exists)  
sign of the charges in these structures does not matter  
there is no electrostatic attraction  

reduction subscripts can occur (they share electrons in many different ways) (will not show all possible formations of said compound though)
they need space to share the electrons (lewis structures need to be drawn)  

electrons by themself in a lewis structure are not happy (if any are left, said compound can not exist)  
this should be used to determine if a compound exists, not reducing subscripts  
either 2, 4, or 6 electrons can be shared  
all elements (except hydrogen) should have 8 valence electrons  

one oxygen can not share to two carbons (just does not exist in chemistry)  
if such structure (like a triangle) exists in your drawing, that compound does not exist  
'cycles' do not exist either (an oxygen reaching across a carbon to another oxygen won't exist)  
an atom should only be one side of another atom (O - C - O)

# Sept. 10, 2024 - Lewis Structures

## Coordinate Bonds
an already bonded group of 2 electrons (say in nitrogen), shares its pair of two electrons with another element  
only exists for period 2 nonmetals  
for subsequent periods, the valence electrons are farther away, and the sharing can be substituted for something else  
a full lone pair is being shared (very, very weak bond)  

only kick out electrons for elements that are "unhappy"  
difficult to kick out electrons for "happy" elements  
contrary to ionic compounds, harder to make != harder to break, rather, it makes the covalent compound harder to form  

all atoms at the end of the drawing must have 8 total electrons, or else the compound does not exist  
oxygen can not bind with another oxygen ever  
a polyatomic must have the same charge across different 'variants' for it to be considered the same polyatomic  

NO4 (1-) - pernitrate (does not exist)  
NO3 (1-) - nitrate  
NO2 (1-) - nitrite  
NO (1-) - hyponitrite - possible, however, you do not to add the extra charge on the 'central' atom (like a metal in an ionic compound)  
(the charge is added to the nitrogen)  
if the charge were to put on the oxygen, a lot more bonding has to happen, making it much more unlikely to be formed than with the result with the extra electron added to the nitrogen  

however, even with the added charge on the central nitrogen atom, the structure is still unlikely to form (due to the extra charge on a central atom)  

**All covalent compounds follow the octet rule**  
Exceptions:   
- Hydrogen must only have 2 electrons  
- Incomplete octet (take BCl3)  

the most imoprtant factor is that  all existing valence electrons are paired up  
since boron had 3 valence electrons, there only being 6 total electrson in the valence shell means it is still satisfied  
the 3 chlorine share their electrons to make the 3 valence electrons of boron paired, thus making boron 'satisfied'  

**Goal number 1: pair single electrons**

- Expanded octet  

for period 3-7 atoms:  
separate lone pairs to make more bonds (SO4 2-)  
satisfied pairs are 'broken apart' into 2 separate electrons to make more bonds  
sulfur ends up having 12 valence electrons, which, since its valence shell is farther from the nucleus, is possible  

# Sept. 11, 2024 - Strength and Drawing of Structures 

## Bond Length 
the more bonds between atoms, the smaller the distance between them, thus the greater the strength  
C=-C is stronger than C-C  

however, the inverse is true for reactions  
double and triple bonds have **delocalized electrons** (free electrons moving around)  
this makes them easier to attack and break apart 
the electrons are not really "stuck" together, the orbitals of the two atoms do not overlap for the second and third bonds  

## Bond Order
**Bond Order** - the number of bonds between atoms  
C-C = bond order of 1  
C=C = bond order of 2  
C=-C = bond order of 3  

**the higher the bond order, the stronger the compound**  

Exceptions:  
- Resonance structures (does not always exist)  
the double bond between O-N=O can switch between left and right, making the compound **not** strong, it makes the compound weaker  
opposed to O=N=O, the double bond has nowhere to switch, and thus is strong  

**bond domains** - number of areas where there are bonds (or the number of atoms bonded)  
**bond order** = number of bonds / bond domains (number of atom bondings)  
the more movement between the bonds, the weaker the structure is  

if movement can not occur, resonance does not exists, and thus the bonds are stuck  

for large compounds (like H2CO3), do not sum up the bond order, it does not make sense  
you would have to sum up each individual bond, say between C=O or O-H  
for compounds like CO3 (2-), since its all bonded to one atom, and a resonance structure can exist, then calculating the bond order of the entire compound is possible  

## VSEPR (valence shell electron pair repulsion) and Polarity (vs EN (Electronegativity))

### Polarity
non-polar - extremely weak  
polar - almost as strong as ionic compounds  

### Linear (electron domain and molecular geometry name)
general formula of AX2, where A acts as a metal (the central atom)  
the X acts as the non-metal  
(note both are still non-metals in this case)  
the two X's have an angle of 180 degrees between them (e.g. CO2)  

determing polarity - draw dipoles (refer to paper notes) (looks like an arrow)  
covalent compounds want to have an electrostatic attraction  

Ex: CO2  
dipole - slightly positive carbon to slightly negative oxygen  
if the bond is strong enough, it will look like carbon is "giving" an electron to oxygen  
it is mimicking the electrostatic attraction of ionic compounds  
but since they go both ways for O=C=O, the dipoles **cancel out**  
(the overall displacement is 0; the strength is the same on the left and right since it is a 180 degree angle)  

therefore the compound is non-polar (a weak covalent structure since there is no mimicking of electrostatic attraction)  

### Electronegativity (refer to a periodic table):  
Ex: CO2  
oxygen - carbon = 3.4 - 2.6 = 0.8 (this is a magnitude calculation; it can never be negative)  
0 - 0.4 = non-polar  
0.4 - 1.7 = polar  
1.7+ = ionic (not true ionic, just mimicks the properties of the strength of ionic compounds)  

electronegativity is not a definitive answer, the dipoles define its polarity  
the 0.8 on the left bond cancels out the 0.8 on the right bond  
in a singular C-O bond, the 0.8 electronegativity could be used to say the bond *could* be polar  
electronegativity is not a definitive answer, it has a lower "priority" than the dipoles  

electronegativity is used to compare and determine the **levels of strength**  

polarity is not normally stated for ions, as whatever added to the strucutre can drastically change the polarity of the structure  

### Trigonal Planar (electron domain and molecular geometry name)
general formuala - AX3  
angle between the X's is 120 degrees  

dipoles *normally* go from the central atom to the outer atoms  
the lower the EN value, the more it acts like a metal (refer to the EN values of metals)  

forms a **symmetrical structure** (dipoles do not matter, they cancel out)  
forms a non-polar structure (cancels out, difficult to see in 2D as it looks like a triangle)  
it is *generally* non-polar, although certain factors could change that

BCL2F could be polar, as it is no longer symmetrical (as opposed to BCL3)  

#### Subgroup (molecular geometry is bent, electron domain remains the same)
AX2E -> has a 117 degree spread  
E is a **lone pair**  
it is no longer symmetrical  

Ex: O3  
the lone pair from E adds repulsion, making a compound like O3 turn from linear to bent  
since O3 is only made up of oxygen, the EN **difference** is 0, and thus it is non-polar 

### Tetrahedral
AX4 -> has a 109.5 degree spread  
symmetrical, and therefore **non-polar**  

CH4 is non-polar, but if it were changed to CH3CL, it would be polar, as it is no longer symmetrical  
in a "pure" AX4 formula, all the dipoles are canceled out  
the bond length has also changed, the bond length between C-H and C-Cl is different  

#### Subgroup 1 (trigonal pyramidal is the molecular geometry, electron domain is still Tetrahedral)
AX3E -> spread of 107 degrees  
E is a lone pair  
lone pairs sit very close to the central atom, creating a strong repulsive force  

this structure is no longer symmetrical, and thus the dipoloes do not cancel out anymore  
therefore, this is polar  

draw the dipoles from positive to negative  

# Sept. 12, 2024 

#### Subgroup 2 of Tetrahdedral (molecular geometry is bent, electron domain is still Tetrahedral)  
formula = AX2E2 -> spread of 105 degrees   

Ex: H2O  
since it is not symmetrical, it is polar  

## Intromalecular and Intermolecular Forces  
**Intra** - within a molecule (EN, polarity)  
**Inter** - between molecules (connection of molecules between each other)  
in ionic compounds, there are lattice structures, but those do not exist in covalent compounds  

factors for intermolecular strength:  
- H-bonding  
- dipole-dipole  
- induced dipole  
- London dispersion (LDF)  

the more factors present, the stronger the solution  
there will only be at most 3 out of the 4 factors present *normally*

### Hydrogen bonds
when H bonds with N, O, or F, there is added strength due to higher EN difference  
the natural moving of hydrogen bonds in water gives water energy  
in theory, up to 4 hydrogens can be bonded to the central oxygen in water (although it will almost never happen)  

### Dipole-Dipole  
only exists in the solid state for covalent compounds  
only in solids will the different molecules be permanently stuck in position for the dipole force to form  
solid particles really only vibrate and rotate  

### Induced dipoles
for liquids and gas  
temporary force that exists because molecules are always moving  
forces are constantly being formed and broken apart as molecules move around  

this force only exists **some** of the times  
this force still helps however  

Ex: CH4 (g)  
less likely for a different molecule's hydrogen to form an induced dipole with the central carbon due to the number of hydrogen atoms around the carbon
and due to the speed at which gas particles move at  

induced dipoles are best for liquids, as with a gas, they are less likely to form  

### London Dispersion Force (LDF)  
based on size  
**all** covalent compounds have this force  

used to compare similar structures (carbon-hydrogen structure with another carbon-hydrogen structure)  

Ex: CH4 vs C2H6  
the bigger the compound, the more likely an induced dipole there is to form  
when molecules move around, the larger compound is more likely to form the induced dipole  
as size increases, the LDF increases, and strength increases  

thus, C2H6 is stronger as it is a larger compound, and therefore an induced dipole is more likely to form  

**this force is closely related to induced dipoles**  

this is not the *best* force, as all elements have a LDF to an extent  

## Covalent Network Structures  
also affect the strength of covalent compounds   
**allotropes** - different versions of the same element but presented in different ways

Ex: carbon allotropes  
appears as diamond, graphite, amorphous carbon, and graphene  
(all of them look differently, but they are all still carbon)  

form differently due to temperature and pressure differences  

diamond is the strongest as each carbon is bound to 4 other carbons, all the other variants only have 3 carbons bound to each carbon  
the goal of these structures is to **look like** a lattice structure  
wants to mimick the strength of ionic compounds  

carbon has the highest melting point (even though it is a non-metal) because of these structures  

once carbon is in a compound (and not by itself) it loses this strength, the strength comes from the network structures  

Ex: SiO2  
in actuality, each silicon in this compound binds to 4 different oxygens  
most likely caused by the fact it is in period 3, and thus more manipulation can happen  
SiO2 forms **network structure** with oxygen  

Ex: P4  
phosphorus also makes a covalent network structure, which increases the strength of the compound  

Ex: S8  
forms a covalent network structure, which improves the strength  

these covalent network structure were found as these compounds were found naturally by themselves (white and red phosphorus)  
these non-metals only exists on earth by themselves due to these covalent network structures  

# Sept. 17, 2024 

weak interacts with weak -> non-polar dissolves / interacts with non-polar, polar interacts with polar  
non-polar and polar will majority of the time, not interact or react  

## Oxidation State vs Charge
**oxidation state can equal to the charge or represent a different electron movement**  

Ex:  
oxidation state: +2, charge: 2+  

Ex: Fe3O4  
charge can not explain how there are 3 iron atoms  
use the *assumed* charge of oxygen (2-, not the observed 3- here), to calculate the oxidation states of iron and oxygen in this compound  

oxidation states should lign up with the charge as often as possible  

for the hydrogen peroxide family, oxygen *may* have a oxidation state of -1  

oxidation state tells us how many electrons an atom has "gained" or "lost" in a compound (even in covalent compounds)  
say carbon has an oxidation state of +2 in a covalent compound  
when carbon bonded with a different atom, even though they are sharing electrons, carbon "lost" more electrons than it gained in
that sharing of electrons, i.e. it "lost" 2 electrons

hydrogen is normally +1, unless it is bound to a group 1 metal, then it is a -1 charge  
oxygen is normally -2, unless it is part of a hydroxide (bound to a group 1 metal), then it becomes a -1 charge  

**when oxygen is bound to a halogen, in the chemical formula, write the halogen first**  
e.g. (F2O not OF2)  

# Sept. 18, 2024  

## Metallic Bonding and Strength
**alloy** - two metals mixed together  
not ionic or molecular, it is their own type  
metals must be liquids to form an alloy  

not all metals can mix together (like oil and water)  
alloys can be very weak, or very strong  
metals are normally strong, so weak alloys are normally never made  

steel (very strong alloy, iron corrodes too fast, and steel corrodes slower)  
carbon is very strong (highest melting point on the periodic table), and can be used in alloys  

strength comes from a smaller atomic radius  
elements nearing the end of a period get their shells more and more compressed (more protons get added, stronger attractional force)  
the smaller radius, the stronger  

the higher the cation charge, the stronger a metal  
transition metals can have very high positive charge  
free electrons (delocalized electrons) can form easily  
all metals want to **lose** electrons  

in an alloy, both metals want to release their electrons, creating delocalized electrons  
once cooled, the atoms are now *more* positive  
the free electrons are now attracted to the positive atoms  
the atoms and electrons do not want to bind, but they are attracted (recall the octet rule, everything wants to look like a noble gas)  

a **sea** of delocalized electrons is formed  
the cations and sea of delocalized electrons attract  
this forms a **layered system** (similar to a lattice structure)  

alloys are said to be malleable and have a high melting / boiling point  
they are mostly conductive in a solid or molten state  

as alloys are heated up, they start losing properties and become weaker and weaker  

factors for strength:  
- small atomic radius (normally stays higher up on the periodic table)  
- high cation charge (transition metals have a higher charge)  

## Bond Continuum (Bond Triangle)  
last way of looking at strength between ionic, polar, nonpolar, molecular compounds  
used with electronegativity values  

it is used to determine a compound's **properties**, not its type  

calculate the delta x (electronegativity) of the compound  
subtract the smaller number from the bigger number (electronegativity of a compound is found in the data booklet)  

then average out the electronegativity of the compound  

average is the x-axis  
delta x is the y-axis  

# Sept. 23, 2024 

## Organic Nomenclature
naming system based on number of carbons:  
1 - meth  
2 - eth  
3 - prop  
4 - but  
5 - pent  
6 - hex  
7 - hept  
8 - oct  
9 - non  
10 - dec  

functional groups cause a change to the suffix

### Alkane 
suffix is -ane  
**only single bonded carbons + hydrogens**  
Ex: CH4  

when naming, we look for the longest possible chain  
if something sits outside the longest chain, it is considered to be a side chain  

side chains have a suffix of '-yl'  
we must also provide a number for the location it is in  
must be the lowest position number   

if there are multiple side chains, they get written in alphabetical order - still with lowest position number for all of them  

maximize the length of the carbon chain  
the chain can bend, but not backtrack  

if there are multiple side chains that are of the same functional group, use covalent compound nomenclature to number the side chains  
Ex: 2,3-dimethyl hexane  

### Side Chain Isomers
in a side chain, when carbons attach to a 'central' carbon, not in a 'chain'  

propyl:  
- isopropyl  

butyl:  
- t-butyl  
- isobutyl 
- sec-butyl  

in the case of something like 6-isobutyl-4-t-butyl, sort alphabetically by prefix (this example is correct)  

# Sept. 24, 2024 

## Cyclic Alkanes
has a prefix **cyclo-**  
can be on the parent or side chain  
*does* count toward alphabetical naming  

a chain can not connect to a side chain to have one long chain  
although it does not break any rules, a cyclic chain is its **own** structure  

## Halogens as Side Chains
- f -> fluoro 
- cl -> chloro  
- br -> bromo  
- i -> iodo

## Alkenes
**suffix of parent chain is -ene**  
has at least 1 double bond between carbons  
number priority is now given to the double bond location not the side chains  

cyclohex-1,3,5-triene is also known as **benzene**    
however, in a side chian, it is known as **phenyl**    
this is the one exception where you can draw a line group  

for benzne, numbering takes priority based on size  

## Alkynes
**suffix is now -yne**  
has at least 1 triple bond  
priority: alkyne > alkene > alkane  
therefore, triple bond must have lowest possible number location  

# Sept. 25, 2024  

priority:   
carboxylic acid > ester > amide > aldehyde > ketone > ether > alcohol > amine > alkyne > alkene > alkane  

## Alcohol
suffx is **ol**  
contains an OH (hydroxide)  

keep the *ane* from alkane (there will always be single bonds), drop the *e*, and add the *ol*  

benzene + 1 OH = phenol  
benzene + 2 or more OH = benzene-1,2,...-[prefix]ol  

## Ether
suffix of the **side chain** is **oxy**  
contains a \~C-O-C~  

choosing the side or parent chain depends on the length of the carbon chain attached to the oxygen  
the longer chain will be the parent  
#1 carbon is always the carbon touching the oxygen  

## Aldehyde
suffixes changes to **al**  
this is always #1 in terms of position so no # is needed in the name  
therefore the ending will always be -anal  
contains H-C=O  

simiar to alcohol, take the *ane* from alkane, drop the e, append 'al'  

## Ketone 
also contains C=O but somewhere in the middle of the carbon chain  
suffix is **one**  

number for location is needed for larger compounds  

suffix is *anone* for small compounds  

prefer to not add the number than add the number  
should only be possible for prop and but  

# Sept. 26, 2024 

## Carboxylic acids  
always at the start of carbon chains (similar to aldehydes)  
therefore always in #1 position -> does not need number in name  
suffix changes to **-oic acid**  

contains a O=C-OH  

## Esters 
parent chain is attached to the C=O  
side chain is always attached to the oxygen   
suffix is **-oate**  

contains a O-C=O  

#1 carbon is always touching the oxygen  

## Amine
contains a nitrogen attached to the hydrogen or carbon groups  
longest carbon chain is the parent chain  
the other carbon chains attached to the nitrogen are side chains and get an N placed before the name  
suffix is **amine**  

#1 carbon is the carbon touching the nitrogen  

## Amide
N-C=O  

carbon chain attached to C=O is the parent chain  
all other carbon chains are side chains  
suffix is amide  

#1 carbon is the carbon touching the nitrogen  

# Oct. 1, 2024 - Types of Reactions

## Synthesis
A + B -> AB  
Na + Cl2 / 2 -> NaCl  

PCl3 + Cl2 -> PCl5  
must be the same element for it to be synthesis and not single-displacement  

synthesis - produces one compound  

SiCl4 + Cl2 -> no RxN  
although silicon is in period 3 and can have an expanded octet, there is no space for the new chlorines  

**non-metal oxides + water -> acids**  
N2O3 + H2O -> 2HNO2 (ternary acid, there are three elements)  

**metal oxides + water -> base** (metal + hydroxide)  
MgO + H2O -> Mg(OH)2  

## Decomposition
AB -> A + B  
NaCl -> Na + 1/2 Cl2  

**metal nitrate -> metal nitrite + oxygen gas**  
Ca(NO3)2 -> Ca(NO2)2 + O2  

**metal carbonate -> metal oxide + carbon dioxide**  
Al2(CO3)3 -> AlO3 + CO2  

**metal bicarbonate -> metal oxide + water + carbon dioxide**  
2NaHCO3 -> Na2O + H2O + 2CO2  

**metal hydroxide -> metal oxide + water**  
2LiOH -> Li2O + H2O  

**metal chlorate -> metal chloride + oxygen gas**  
Be(ClO3)2 -> BeCl2 + 3/2 O2  

# Oct. 2, 2024

## Single Displacement
If A is a metal  
A + BC -> AC + B  

need to refer to an activity series to verify that A can displace B  
Ex: Li + FeCl3 -> 3LiCl + Fe  
Ex: Zn + NaF -> No RxN  
Ex: Al + 3H2O (HOH) -> Al(OH)3 + 3/2 H2 (experimentally, nothing happens -> needs more energy than room temperature water)  

If A is a nonmetal  
A + BC -> BA + C  

If A and C are halogens we use the activity series of halogens; shown on periodic table  
F > Cl > Br > I  

Ex: N2 + 6LiCl -> 2Li3N + 3Cl2  
F2 + 2NaBr -> 2NaF + Br2  
I2 + MgCl2 -> No RxN  

# Oct. 3, 2024 

## Double Displacement
AB + CD -> AD + CB  

if NH4OH is ever produced, it will decompose to NH3 + H2O (very weak compound, and can not exist in that compound)  
if H2CO3 is produced, it will become CO2 + H2O  

## Combustion
organic compound + oxygen gas  
complete combustion has excess oxygen + produces only CO2 and H2O  
if the organic compound contains nitrogen it also produces NO2  

incomplete combustion has limited oxygen + produces a variety of possible products:  
- CO2
- H2O
- CO
- C 
- H2 

complete combustion burns clean, producing white smoke  
incomplete combustion produces black / grey smoke  

elements + oxygen that yield energy can be both synthesis *and* combustion  

when balancing, assume complete combustion, as incomplete combustion yields random products  

# Oct. 15, 2024 - Unit 2: Matter + Energy

## Matter
solid, liquid, gas, plasma  

a solid undergoes *sublimation* to become a gas  
a gas undergoes *deposition* to become a solid  

gas *ionizes* into plasma (generally requires a large amount of energy)  
plasma *recombines (recombination)* into a gas  

the enthalpy of a system increases in this order: solid -> liquid -> gas -> plasma  

lowering the energy of a solid even more yields a **bose-einstein state**, particles are nearly (or at) a standstill  

temperature (kelvin) = temperature (celsius) + 273  

**exothermic** - the system itself (although energy is being put in) increases in energy (kinetic energy / temperature goes up; solid -> liquid)  
**endothermic** - the system itself decreases in energy (kinetic energy / temperature goes down; gas -> liquid)  

**filtration** - a physical process where a liquid containing suspended solid particles is passed through a fine 
screen to separate the solid from the liquid  
**distillation** - a method to separate liquids by heating them up to a gas and separating them due to the two liquids' different boiling points  

## Pure Substances vs Mixtures
pure substances - atoms and compounds  
tap water is *not* a pure substances, yet H2O is  

salt water is a **homogenous mixture** (a solution)   
a **heterogenous mixture** is where you can see two distinct *phases*, e.g. sand in water  

## Atomic Theory and Subatomic Particles
protons, neutrons, electrons  
**atoms can not be created or destroyed; the energy is just transformed**  

neutrons have the same number of positive and negative charges (thus making them neutral)  

nucleus size stays the same, but as you descend the periodic table, more positive charges are shoved into the nucleus, all of which repel each other  
this causes the elements further down the periodic table to be more unstable, radioactive, etc.  

neutrons help mitigate some of the positive charges via **induction** (the positive proton attracts the negative side of the neutron)  

### Isotopes
neutrons are responsible for forming isotopes  
every element on the periodic table is an **average** of all the isotopes of the element  

atoms are constantly being bombarded with energy  
atoms must do something with that energy  
it uses the *other* subatomic particles to transform the energy into neutrons  

if too many neutrons get formed, the nucleus gets "overwhelemed" and is "destroyed" as it is too unstable and the energy is fully transferred outward  
produces a **radioisotope**  
(Ex: uranium in a nuclear power plant)  

the atom can not handle that many neutrons forever  

Ex:  
- C-14 -> used for bone decay carbon dating
- Co-60 -> used to kill bacteria in food
- Tech-99 -> used for diagnosing cancer
- 1H proton -> primarily makes H2
- 2H deuterium -> used as a coolant, fuel in nuclear fusion, drugs / medical tracing
- 3H tritium -> nuclear weapons (hydrogen bombs)

## Energy
continuum spectrum - all visible light  
emission line spectrum - what frequencies of light a particle reflects  
absorption line spectrum - the frequences of light a particle absorbs  

continuum spectrum = emission line spectrum ^ absorption line spectrum  
``` c
assert(INT32_MAX == (continuum spectrum = emission line spectrum ^ absorption line spectrum));  
```

all elements have all the oribtals, though they might not need them (hydrogen has at least 7 orbitals)  

when an atom receives energy, an electron can get **excited** and jump energy levels (creates the *absorption* spectrum)  
the electron can not stay in this high energy state, and will eventually move back down (creates the *emission* spectrum)  

all atoms have a **unique** line spectrum  

every electron is unique  
one electron jumping energy levels requires different energy than a different electron (as they will be in different energy levels)  
two electrons of the same energy level can not both jump at the same time due to the electrostatic attraction of the nucleus  

# Oct. 17, 2024 

## Schrodinger's Atomic Model
electron can be anywhere  
there are certain areas where the electron is more **likely** to be  

the protons in the nucleus can move around  
makes electrons have a non-circular orbit  

only when an electron goes back down to shell **2** can it be seen, to shell 1 it releases too much energy, and it is outside the 
visible wavelength (it is ultraviolet)  

the **Balmer series** is the series describing a jump back to shell 2  
a drop to shell 3 yields infrared light (invisible)  

when an atom drops energy levels, even if a shell is already full, it can drop to that shell (although it is more difficult than normal)  
the electron will correct itself after  
the electron can drop down to any shell  

## Calculations for Energy
E = hf (energy = planck's constant * frequency)  
c = f * lambda (speed of light = frequency * wavelength)  

frequency is used more in physics, wavelength is more used in chemistry  

energy is in **joules**  

**refer to physical notes for both Rydberg equations**  

if an particle emits a colour, look to the opposite of the colour wheel to see what colour the particle absorbed  

## Electron Configuration
4 sublevels of energy can exist in each energy level  

S - 1 orientation, maximum 2 electrons  
P - 3 orientations, maximum 2 electron in each for a total of 6 (Px, Py, Pz)   
D - 5 orientations, max of 2 electron in each for a total of 10  
F - 7 orientations, max of 2 electrons for a total of 14  

a sublevel must be filled before moving on to the next sublevel  

the electrons travel in pair along the orientation  
one electron spins leftward, the other spins rightward, as they still want to repel each other  

each electron has a magnetic field  
the fields are stronger than the negative charge  
as they spin in different directions, they create opposite magnetic fields, which attract  

H - 1s^1  
1 - the period  
s - the electron sublevel  
^1 - the number of electrons in the sublevel  

Li - 1s^(2)2s^1  

follow the arrows on the SPDF chart  

# Oct. 18, 2024

SPDF has exceptions for the group Chromium (Cr) and Copper (Cu) is in  
electrons are more easier to manipulate for these elements due to **electron shielding**  
the atoms can be presented in a more stable way (only **one** electron is being displaced to improve stability)  

in the sublevels, electrons do not pair unless they have to

for chromium d^4 has one electron in each orientation (except the fifth one)  
thus, one electron from 4s^2 comes "down" to make d^5 (more stable than d^4 as all the orientations at least have one electron)  

for Vanadium, ending in 4s^2 3d^3, no electrons are moved as only **one** electron can move to create more stability due to the
increasing difficulty to move more and more electrons  

## Ions 
always "attack" the valence electrons  

period 3 element are happy with 8 electrons in its valence shell as there are no transition metals, thus the **d** sublevel will never be reached  
if the d sublevel is never even reached, filling the p sublevel satisfies the element  

for transition metals, always attack the s sublevel first  

as chromium approches a charge of 6+, chromium is said to have covalent properties  
more energy creates more neutrons, making it closer to a radioisotope, and thus making it lose its strength  

## Orbital Level Diagrams
refer to phyiscal notes  

## Periodic Trends
**ionization energy** - the amount of energy needed to remove an electron in its gas state  
**electron affinity** - energy needed to add an electron in an atom in its gas state  
first electron gained is an **exothermic** release, second electron is an **endothermic** release  
a negative energy means that the addition of the electron was so "easy" that there was left-over energy to form an *exothermic* release  

when an electron is lost, it comes with its ionization energy  
this energy is used to add the electron to another element (its *electron affinity*)  
if the ionization energy > electron affinity of the other element, the electron affinity of the other element is **negative**  

the higher the ionization energy, the harder to remove an electron  
the higher the elctron affinity, the easier it is to gain an electron  

# Oct. 22, 2024

**atomic radius** - the larger thple atom, the more *shielding* occurs, which makes the valence electron more and more reactive  

Ex: why is phosphorus' ionization energy higher than sulphur?  
P - ...3p3  
S - ...3p4  

- a half filled orientation is the next best altnerative to a fully-filled orientation  
- S has 4 electrons in p, it "wants" to go to 3 electrons to be half filled  
- the slight repulsion in one of the orientations make it easier for S to lose an electron  

why does sulphur have a higher melting point?  

- S8 vs P4 - higher LDF for S  
- S has an extra proton, increase attraction, which lowers atomic radius, increasing strength (it has a better **effective nuclear charge**)  

# Oct. 29, 2024 - Unit 3 - Stoichiometry

## Moles 
mole represents the amount of particles  
each mole has 6.02 \* 10^23 particles  

unit for Avogrado's constant is N\_a (n subscript a) that best represents the type of particle  
elements -> atoms / mol  
ionic compounds -> formula units / mol   
covalent compounds -> molecules / mol  
ions -> ions / mol  

**n = N / N_a**  
n = moles (measured in mol)  
N = # of entities (measured by type of particle)   
N\_a = Avogrado's number (a constant)  

finds the number of particles in a given number of moles (or the other way around)  

**note: amount of substance = number of moles**  

**note: constants never interfere with the significant digits of the final answer**  

## Relative Atomic Mass
multiplying a mole of atoms by 1.66 \* 10^(-24) gives the relative atomic mass in **grams**  

relative atomic mass is used to make math easier  

## Molar mass 
total mass of all elements present in a compound  

Ex: MgCl2  
M (molar mass) = 1Mg + 2Cl  
M = 24.31 \* 2(35.45)  
M = 95.21 g / mol  

n (moles) = m (mass in grams) / M (molar mass in g / mol)  

molar mass is treated as a **constant** in the equation (therefore it does not affect s.f. of the final answer)  

# Oct. 31, 2024 

## Empirical vs Molecular  
a compound in lowest terms (does **not** not have to be an actual compound)  

a molecular formula is a multiple of an empirical formula (**does** exist as a real compound)  

### Empirical to Molecular Formula
x = (molar mass of empirical) / (molar mass of empirical formula)  

x is the factor to multiply all the subscripts by to get the molecular formula  

x is always a whole number  
*if* there it is a real number, find the lowest factor to multiply it by to get a whole number (these are subscripts of atoms,
they can't be not whole numbers)  

## Hydrates
ionic compounds with water as part of the chemical formula  
separated by a \*, similar to a multiplication sign  

stored in water to reduce reactivity with air and improve lifetime of the compound  

**anhydrous** - the compound without the water  

**refer to physical notes for example problems and better explanations**  

# Nov. 1, 2024 

## Molar Concentrations
**solute** - ionic compound  
**solvent** - most of the time, water  

c (concentration) = n / v  

c is in mol / dm^3 (dm^3 is the same as litres)  

1ml = 1cm^3  
1dm^3 = 1000cm^3 (10^3)  
1dm^3 = 1000ml  
1dm^3 = 1L  

mol / dm^3 is also shown as M  

n = moles  
v = volume (dm^3)  

[] = concentration  

## Dilutions
decrease the concentration of the solute  

C1V1 = C2V2  
C1 is considered a stock solution (initial solution) it is from the producer  

solutions made by us would still be C1, but not a stock solution as the solution is *uncertain*  

V2 is the final volume  

**always use the lowest given sig figs for the final answer**  

### Small Concentrations
parts per million / billion  
ppm or ppb  

ppm = mg (solute) / kg (total) or mg / dm^3  

general formula = solute / total where total is in a unit 1,000,000 (for ppm) times bigger than the solute  

# Nov. 4, 2024 - Gases

## Avogrado's Law 
equal volumes of all gases (when measured at the same temperature and pressure) contain equal amount of particles  

therefore, volume is proportional to moles only for reactions that all reactants and products are in the gas phase  

## Standards
STP - standard temperature and pressure at 0 degrees celsius (273 kelvin)  
pressure = 100kPa  
used more commonly in gas calculations  

SATP - standard ambient temperature pressure at 25 degrees celsius (298 kelvin)  
pressure = 100kPa  
SATP is used as a laboratory standard  

1 atm = 101.325 kPa = 14.7 psi = 760 mm Hg  

## Assumptions
- gas particles are in constant motion (which is an impossible assumption)  
- individual gas particles are considered point masses (no volume and takes up no space); real gas occupies a volume under high pressure  
- gas particles do not exert attractive or repulsive forces on each other  
- gas particles interact in elastic collisions (equal energy before and after)  

these assumptions are made as their effects on calculations are **negligible**  
these assumptions create an **ideal gas** (ideal conditions)  

## Molar Volume
n = V (volume) / v (molar volume)  

v is a constant at STP  
v = 22.7 dm^3 / mol  

## Boyles Law
P is inversely proportional to V (assume temperature and moles are constant)  

P1V1 = P2V2  

## Charles Law
V is proportional to T (assuming pressure and moles are constant)  

V1/T1 = V2/T2  

## Guy - Lussac's Law
P is proportional to T (assuming volume and moles are constant)  

P1/T1 = P2/T2  

## Combined Gas Law 
assuming moles is constant  

P1V1 / T1 = P2V2 / T2  

## Ideal Gas Law 
pV = nRT  

R is a gas constant = 8.31 J/(K (kelvin) \* mol)  
p is pressure in kPa  
T is pressured in Kelvin
V is volume in dm^3  
n is moles in moles  

if all the units match, they can be safely canceled out  
**note: kPa \* dm^3 = J**  

# Nov. 7, 2024

## Mole Ratios
ensure the chemical equation is balanced  
the coefficient of a compound of either a reactant or product can be put in a ratio with another compound to determine the number of moles  

states do not matter, unlike Avogrado's law, which dictates the states of both compounds must be gaseous  

**note: Avogrado's law is a subset of mole ratios**  

## Limiting and Excess
for this course (11 sl chemistry), this will only be computed with 2 reactants  
using mole ratios, determine the quantity ***needed*** of the reactants  

two values should arise, those are your **needed** values  

now, compute the actual mass of the two reactants (which may be given)  
these values are the values you **have**  

the compound where the **have** value is less than the **needed** value is the limiting factor  
this compound is used up first in reactions, and thus more of the product can not be produced, as this compound is fully used up  

therefore, **product amounts are dependent on the limiting reactant**  

when solving for precipitates / number of moles of a product, always use the **limiting factor**

Ex:  
2A + 3B -> ..., where A is given as 1 mol, and B is 2 mol  

solving the quantity of B **needed**:  
A / B = 2/3 (coefficients of A and B) = 1/x (moles of A and B)  
x = 3/2 mol of B **needed**  

solving the quantity of A **needed**:  
A / B = 2/3 = x/2  
x = 4/3 mol of A **needed**  

thus, the **needed** quantity of A is 4/3 mol, and for B, it is 3/2 mol  
since there is only 1 mol available (refer back to the question) of A, A is the **limiting factor**  

## Titration Reactions
often used for acid / base reactions  

goal is to find the concentration of an acid / base  
also tries to monitor for an **equivalence point**  

equivalence point - where the properties of the acid + base have reached an *equilibrium*   
can be found using a pH probe or chemical indicators  

## Percentage Yield
used to calculate how much of a precipitate or gas has been formed on the product side  
if mole ratios are needed, remember to use the coefficient of the **limiting factor**  

percentage yield = (experimental yield / theoretical yield) \* 100  

remaining = have - need  

# Nov. 12, 2024

## Atom Economy
brief look at **green chemistry**  
green chemistry - running a reaciton to limit waste or increase desired yield to reduce the use of toxic chemicals  

atom economy = (molar mass of desired product) / (total molar mass of products or reactants) \* 100  

a balanced chemical reaction is needed as the **coefficients** will be used as well  

actual result is -(10 - 15)% due to real-world factors, inefficient reactions, etc.  

only time coefficients are used with molar mass  
coefficients are normally only used for mole ratios  

## Significant Digit Rules
all numbers between 1-9 are significant  

all zero's between or after the numbers 1-9 are significant  

exceptions:  
if the number does not have a decimal at the end the zero's after the numbers 1-9 do not count  
Ex:  
100 -> 1 s.f.  
100\. -> 3 s.f.  

all zero's before numbers 1-9 do not count  

constants do not affect significant digits in the final answer  

if rounding with 5:  
- if the number before is odd, round up, if it is even, round down  
- this is only for number digits exactly on a 5 (ex: 3.452 -> 3.5; 3.45000 -> 3.4)  

### Addition / Subtraction
final answer is based on lowest number of decimal places in the original question, **not** s.f.  
only applies for formulas **only** using addition and subtraction  

### Multiplication / Division
final must have the lowest **significant digits** based on the original question, **not** decimal places  
takes priority over the addition / subtraction rule if both are present in a formula  

## Error
**note: errors propagate**  

2 types:  
- systematic (determinate error) - due to poor experimental design, procedure, or machine; may be out of your control; will always exist;
can't be reduced, but can be fixed (e.g. choosing a better tool)
- random error (indeterminate error) - due to uncontrolled variables in measurements, normally through human error; can be reduced;
always present, but can be reduced by repeating trials

**accuracy** - how close the measured value is to the true / accepted value  
**precision** - when multiple trials result in similar results, refers to data  

random errors should **never** be included in a lab report, only systematic errors should be included  

## Uncertainty
+- some value compared to the measured value  

in addition / subtraction, always **add** the uncertanties  
answer is always in lowest decimal places of the **uncertainty** (even for multiplication and division)  

**absolute uncertainty** - literal decimal numbers in the uncertainty  
**relative uncertainty** - percentages in the uncertainty  

for multiplication / division, turn the uncertainty into relative uncertainty by dividing the uncertainty by the measured value  
then add up the percentages (relative uncertainties)  

for all final answers, uncertainties should be in **absolute** not relative  

### Averages
averages come from the same tool, and thus the uncertainties do not need to be averaged  

if the average is the median, and the distance to the max and min are the same, the uncertainty becomes the difference between
the max and the min

### Deriving Uncertainty 
finding the uncertainty of tools that are not given (such as a stopwatch)  

sum = sqrt( ((sum(i = 1 to n) (x\_i (number in dataset) - x (average)) ^ 2) / (n (total number of measurements) - 1) )    
standard deviation yields the **absolute** uncertainty  

(max - min) / average is acceptable on a test instead of standard deviation  
this yields the **relative** uncertainty of the data set  

(max - min) yields the **absolute** uncertainty of the data set  

# Dec. 9, 2024 - Thermochemistry

**three types of systems**:  
- open system (ex: beaker with no lid)  
matter can enter and leave the system  
heat can be lost  
- closed system (ex: beaker with a lid)  
matter is trapped (nothing can leave or enter)  
however, heat can still be transfered out of the system  
- isolated system (ex: thermos, calorimeter)    
matter is trapped  
heat is trapped  

## Temperature vs. Heat
- temperature is **only** a measure of kinetic energy of molecules in a given amount of space  
- heat is a form of **energy** transferred from one area to another (ex: system to surrounding and vice versa)  

heat leads to **enthalpy**  
**enthalpy change (ΔH)** is the measure of how much heat is **transferred**  

## Exothermic and Endothermic
exothermic reaction **produces heat**  
endothermic reaction **loses heat**  

**activation energy** - amount of energy needed to start a reaction (ex: ionization energy)  

## Calculating Heat 
Q = mcΔT  
Q = heat (kJ or J)  
m = mass (g or kg)  
c = specific heat capacity (J g^-1 K^-1)  
ΔT = change in temperature (K)  

## Calculating Enthalpy
ΔH = -Q / n  
enthalpy = kJ / mol  
Q = heat  
n = moles  

if the answer is negative, it is an **exothermic reaction**  
if the answer is positive, it is an **endothermic reaction**  

amount of energy **gained / lost** *during* the reaction  

# Dec. 10, 2024

## Bond Enthalpy
ΔH = Σ(bond energy of bonds broken) - Σ(bond energy of bonds formed)  
(reactants - products)  
remember to **include coefficients**  

the coefficient of the specified compound should be **1**, as the bond enthalpy is in reference to one mole  

# Dec. 11, 2024

## Enthalpy of Formation
ΔH = ΣΔH\_products - ΣΔH\_reactants  
(products - reactants)  
remember to **include coefficients**  

how much energy goes in to the products to make the reactants  

the coefficient of the specified compound should be **1**, as the bond enthalpy is in reference to one mole  

enthalpy of reaction for **elements and diatomic elements** are 0  
water has different enthalpies depending on its state  

**bond enthalpy will never equal enthalpy of formation** (although they will be close and should be the same type of reaction)  

why?  
bond enthalpies are an **average** of all possible permutations that the bond can take (ex: there is a difference between
a ketone and a carbon dioxide, despite both of them being a C=O)  
enthalpy of formation is **specific** to the element => it is more **accurate than bond enthalpies**  

## Hess's Law
sum of multiple reactions to obtain the enthalpy of a desired reaction  

a bit more of an applied application of theoretical calculations  
is used to sum up multiple reactions to get the enthalpy change of **a reaction that can not be measured experimentally**  

**a reactant can not also be a product, thus they can be canceled out**
