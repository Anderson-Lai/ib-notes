### Ionic Compounds
positive charge and negative charge bound together. can only conduct electricity when it is NOT a stable compound.
dissolving in water is a physical change.
the bond's strength comes from the electrostatic attraction. positive and negative force brings them together.
group is a column in the periodic table, row is a period 
the smaller the size, the stronger the attraction (closer to protons)
NaCl is stronger than CsCl due to the less number of shells (Rutherford diagram)
CsCl is thus easier to make, as the electron in the valence shell of Cesium is farther from the protons (less attraction)
(the harder something is to make, the harder it is for that thing to break)

charge is written number first then sign (as opposed to oxidation)
Li2O is Lithium Oxide (note the 'ide')

periodic table only contains the most common charges (for multi-valence elements, but there can be more)
Cr2S3 -> chromium (III) sulfide

Mg + NO3 -> Mg(NO3)2 (remember the brackets, NO3 is a polyatomic compound), magnesium nitrate
pernitrate, nitrate, nitrite, hyponitrite (possible combinations of each polyatomic) (charges: -4, -3, -2, -1)
if the polyatomic can not be drawn (with proper rules), it does not exist

recall: hydrogen is a non-metal, thus water is a covalent compound (albeit it is one of the stronger covalent compounds)
normal (distilled) water has a density of 1 

in lattice structures - smaller is normally the metal, larger is non-metal
H20 is stating the RATIO of elements
the more compacted the elements are into the lattice structure, the stronger the structure
(this concept can be used an idea to prove strength of bonds)
dissolving a structure (compound) in water can be used to test its strength
the more that can dissolve, the weaker the structure
there is no real trend with melting point
the melting point influences the strength of a structure, but it will fluctuate and certain stronger elements will have a lower melting point, 
even when structures should be getting stronger (there are other factors that influence the strength of structures)

#### A single blanket statement can not be made for groups of elements
