## Ionic Compounds  
positive charge and negative charge bound together. can only conduct electricity when it is NOT a stable compound.  
dissolving in water is a physical change.  
the bond's strength comes from the electrostatic attraction. positive and negative force brings them together.  
group is a column in the periodic table, row is a period   
the smaller the size, the stronger the attraction (closer to protons)  
NaCl is stronger than CsCl due to the less number of shells (Rutherford diagram)  
CsCl is thus easier to make, as the electron in the valence shell of Cesium is farther from the protons (less attraction)  
(the harder something is to make, the harder it is for that thing to break)  
  
charge is written number first then sign (as opposed to oxidation)  
Li2O is Lithium Oxide (note the 'ide')  
  
periodic table only contains the most common charges (for multi-valence elements, but there can be more)  
Cr2S3 -> chromium (III) sulfide  
  
Mg + NO3 -> Mg(NO3)2 (remember the brackets, NO3 is a polyatomic compound), magnesium nitrate  
pernitrate, nitrate, nitrite, hyponitrite (possible combinations of each polyatomic) (charges: -4, -3, -2, -1)  
if the polyatomic can not be drawn (with proper rules), it does not exist  
  
recall: hydrogen is a non-metal, thus water is a covalent compound (albeit it is one of the stronger covalent compounds)  
normal (distilled) water has a density of 1   
  
in lattice structures - smaller is normally the metal, larger is non-metal  
H2O is stating the RATIO of elements  
the more compacted the elements are into the lattice structure, the stronger the structure  
(this concept can be used an idea to prove strength of bonds)  
dissolving a structure (compound) in water can be used to test its strength  
the more that can dissolve, the weaker the structure  
there is no real trend with melting point  
the melting point influences the strength of a structure, but it will fluctuate and certain stronger elements will have a lower melting point,   
even when structures should be getting stronger (there are other factors that influence the strength of structures)  
  
### A single blanket statement can not be made for groups of elements  
  
# Sept. 5, 2024 - Lattice Enthalpy

## Lattice Enthalpy
the harder a compound is to make, the harder it is for it to break apart  
lattice energy - the amount of energy needed to break apart the electrostatic attraction  
the more electrons given, the stronger the bond  
electrons move one at a time, after first electron leaves, the attractional force becomes stronger for the element losing electrons  
the element gaining electrons also gains a negative charge, making the incoming electron more repelled and more difficult to be absorbed  

## Aqueous Solutions
in a higher energy state than a solid, and thus are easier to make react  
water is a solvent in this case  
salt would be a solute  

energy is always moving, a solid being dissolved is also always being reformed; however, it is being dissolved
at such a speed where it is not visible  

# Sept. 9, 2024 - Covalent Compounds

## Covalent Structures
criss-cross method still remains  
remember to add prefixes (-ide suffix still exists)  
sign of the charges in these structures does not matter  
there is no electrostatic attraction  

reduction subscripts can occur (they share electrons in many different ways) (will not show all possible formations of said compound though)
they need space to share the electrons (lewis structures need to be drawn)  

electrons by themself in a lewis structure are not happy (if any are left, said compound can not exist)  
this should be used to determine if a compound exists, not reducing subscripts  
either 2, 4, or 6 electrons can be shared  
all elements (except hydrogen) should have 8 valence electrons  

one oxygen can not share to two carbons (just does not exist in chemistry)  
if such structure (like a triangle) exists in your drawing, that compound does not exist  
'cycles' do not exist either (an oxygen reaching across a carbon to another oxygen won't exist)  
an atom should only be one side of another atom (O - C - O)

# Sept. 10, 2024 - Lewis Structures

## Coordinate Bonds
an already bonded group of 2 electrons (say in nitrogen), shares its pair of two electrons with another element  
only exists for period 2 nonmetals  
for subsequent periods, the valence electrons are farther away, and the sharing can be substituted for something else  
a full lone pair is being shared (very, very weak bond)  

only kick out electrons for elements that are "unhappy"  
difficult to kick out electrons for "happy" elements  
contrary to ionic compounds, harder to make != harder to break, rather, it makes the covalent compound harder to form  

all atoms at the end of the drawing must have 8 total electrons, or else the compound does not exist  
oxygen can not bind with another oxygen ever  
a polyatomic must have the same charge across different 'variants' for it to be considered the same polyatomic  

NO4 (1-) - pernitrate (does not exist)  
NO3 (1-) - nitrate  
NO2 (1-) - nitrite  
NO (1-) - hyponitrite - possible, however, you do not to add the extra charge on the 'central' atom (like a metal in an ionic compound)  
(the charge is added to the nitrogen)  
if the charge were to put on the oxygen, a lot more bonding has to happen, making it much more unlikely to be formed than with the result with the extra electron added to the nitrogen  

however, even with the added charge on the central nitrogen atom, the structure is still unlikely to form (due to the extra charge on a central atom)  

**All covalent compounds follow the octet rule**  
Exceptions:   
- Hydrogen must only have 2 electrons  
- Incomplete octet (take BCl3)  

the most imoprtant factor is that  all existing valence electrons are paired up  
since boron had 3 valence electrons, there only being 6 total electrson in the valence shell means it is still satisfied  
the 3 chlorine share their electrons to make the 3 valence electrons of boron paired, thus making boron 'satisfied'  

**Goal number 1: pair single electrons**

- Expanded octet  

for period 3-7 atoms:  
separate lone pairs to make more bonds (SO4 2-)  
satisfied pairs are 'broken apart' into 2 separate electrons to make more bonds  
sulfur ends up having 12 valence electrons, which, since its valence shell is farther from the nucleus, is possible  

# Sept. 11, 2024 - Strength and Drawing of Structures 

## Bond Length 
the more bonds between atoms, the smaller the distance between them, thus the greater the strength  
C=-C is stronger than C-C  

however, the inverse is true for reactions  
double and triple bonds have **delocalized electrons** (free electrons moving around)  
this makes them easier to attack and break apart 
the electrons are not really "stuck" together, the orbitals of the two atoms do not overlap for the second and third bonds  

## Bond Order
**Bond Order** - the number of bonds between atoms  
C-C = bond order of 1  
C=C = bond order of 2  
C=-C = bond order of 3  

**the higher the bond order, the stronger the compound**  

Exceptions:  
- Resonance structures (does not always exist)  
the double bond between O-N=O can switch between left and right, making the compound **not** strong, it makes the compound weaker  
opposed to O=N=O, the double bond has nowhere to switch, and thus is strong  

**bond domains** - number of areas where there are bonds (or the number of atoms bonded)  
**bond order** = number of bonds / bond domains (number of atom bondings)  
the more movement between the bonds, the weaker the structure is  

if movement can not occur, resonance does not exists, and thus the bonds are stuck  

for large compounds (like H2CO3), do not sum up the bond order, it does not make sense  
you would have to sum up each individual bond, say between C=O or O-H  
for compounds like CO3 (2-), since its all bonded to one atom, and a resonance structure can exist, then calculating the bond order of the entire compound is possible  

## VSEPR (valence shell electron pair repulsion) and Polarity (vs EN (Electronegativity))

### Polarity
non-polar - extremely weak  
polar - almost as strong as ionic compounds  

### Linear (electron domain and molecular geometry name)
general formula of AX2, where A acts as a metal (the central atom)  
the X acts as the non-metal  
(note both are still non-metals in this case)  
the two X's have an angle of 180 degrees between them (e.g. CO2)  

determing polarity - draw dipoles (refer to paper notes) (looks like an arrow)  
covalent compounds want to have an electrostatic attraction  

Ex: CO2  
dipole - slightly positive carbon to slightly negative oxygen  
if the bond is strong enough, it will look like carbon is "giving" an electron to oxygen  
it is mimicking the electrostatic attraction of ionic compounds  
but since they go both ways for O=C=O, the dipoles **cancel out**  
(the overall displacement is 0; the strength is the same on the left and right since it is a 180 degree angle)  

therefore the compound is non-polar (a weak covalent structure since there is no mimicking of electrostatic attraction)  

### Electronegativity (refer to a periodic table):  
Ex: CO2  
oxygen - carbon = 3.4 - 2.6 = 0.8 (this is a magnitude calculation; it can never be negative)  
0 - 0.4 = non-polar  
0.4 - 1.7 = polar  
1.7+ = ionic (not true ionic, just mimicks the properties of the strength of ionic compounds)  

electronegativity is not a definitive answer, the dipoles define its polarity  
the 0.8 on the left bond cancels out the 0.8 on the right bond  
in a singular C-O bond, the 0.8 electronegativity could be used to say the bond *could* be polar  
electronegativity is not a definitive answer, it has a lower "priority" than the dipoles  

electronegativity is used to compare and determine the **levels of strength**  

polarity is not normally stated for ions, as whatever added to the strucutre can drastically change the polarity of the structure  

### Trigonal Planar (electron domain and molecular geometry name)
general formuala - AX3  
angle between the X's is 120 degrees  

dipoles *normally* go from the central atom to the outer atoms  
the lower the EN value, the more it acts like a metal (refer to the EN values of metals)  

forms a **symmetrical structure** (dipoles do not matter, they cancel out)  
forms a non-polar structure (cancels out, difficult to see in 2D as it looks like a triangle)  
it is *generally* non-polar, although certain factors could change that

BCL2F could be polar, as it is no longer symmetrical (as opposed to BCL3)  

#### Subgroup (molecular geoemtry is bent, electron domain remains the same)
AX2E -> has a 117 degree spread  
E is a **lone pair**  
it is no longer symmetrical  

Ex: O3  
the lone pair from E adds repulsion, making a compound like O3 turn from linear to bent  
since O3 is only made up of oxygen, the EN **difference** is 0, and thus it is non-polar 

### Tetrahedral
AX4 -> has a 109.5 degree spread  
symmetrical, and therefore **non-polar**  

CH4 is non-polar, but if it were changed to CH3CL, it would be polar, as it is no longer symmetrical  
in a "pure" AX4 formula, all the dipoles are canceled out  
the bond length has also changed, the bond length between C-H and C-Cl is different  

#### Subgroup 1 (trigonal pyramidal is the molecular geometry, electron domain is still Tetrahedral)
AX3E -> spread of 107 degrees  
E is a lone pair  
lone pairs sit very close to the central atom, creating a strong repulsive force  

this structure is no longer symmetrical, and thus the dipoloes do not cancel out anymore  
therefore, this is polar  

draw the dipoles from positive to negative  

# Sept. 12, 2024 

#### Subgroup 2 of Tetrahdedral (molecular geoemetry is bent, electron domain is still Tetrahedral)  
formula = AX2E2 -> spread of 105 degrees   

Ex: H2O  
since it is not symmetrical, it is polar  

## Intromalecular and Intermolecular Forces  
**Intra** - within a molecule (EN, polarity)  
**Inter** - between molecules (connection of molecules between each other)  
in ionic compounds, there are lattice structures, but those do not exist in covalent compounds  

factors for intermolecular strength:  
- H-bonding  
- dipole-dipole  
- induced dipole  
- London dispersion (LDF)  

the more factors present, the stronger the solution  
there will only be at most 3 out of the 4 factors present *normally*

### Hydrogen bonds
when H bonds with N, O, or F, there is added strength due to higher EN difference  
the natural moving of hydrogen bonds in water gives water energy  
in theory, up to 4 hydrogens can be bonded to the central oxygen in water (although it will almost never happen)  

### Dipole-Dipole  
only exists in the solid state for covalent compounds  
only in solids will the different molecules be permanently stuck in position for the dipole force to form  
solid particles really only vibrate and rotate  

### Induced dipoles
for liquids and gas  
temporary force that exists because molecules are always moving  
forces are constantly being formed and broken apart as molecules move around  

this force only exists **some** of the times  
this force still helps however  

Ex: CH4 (g)  
less likely for a different molecule's hydrogen to form an induced dipole with the central carbon due to the number of hydrogen atoms around the carbon
and due to the speed at which gas particles move at  

induced dipoles are best for liquids, as with a gas, they are less likely to form  

### London Dispersion Force (LDF)  
based on size  
**all** covalent compounds have this force  

used to compare similar structures (carbon-hydrogen structure with another carbon-hydrogen structure)  

Ex: CH4 vs C2H6  
the bigger the compound, the more likely an induced dipole there is to form  
when molecules move around, the larger compound is more likely to form the induced dipole  
as size increases, the LDF increases, and strength increases  

thus, C2H6 is stronger as it is a larger compound, and therefore an induced dipole is more likely to form  

**this force is closely related to induced dipoles**  

this is not the *best* force, as all elements have a LDF to an extent  

## Covalent Network Structures  
also affect the strength of covalent compounds   
**allotropes** - different versions of the same element but presented in different ways

Ex: carbon allotropes  
appears as diamond, graphite, amorphous carbon, and graphene  
(all of them look differently, but they are all still carbon)  

form differently due to temperature and pressure differences  

diamond is the strongest as each carbon is bound to 4 other carbons, all the other variants only have 3 carbons bound to each carbon  
the goal of these structures is to **look like** a lattice structure  
wants to mimick the strength of ionic compounds  

carbon has the highest melting point (even though it is a non-metal) because of these structures  

once carbon is in a compound (and not by itself) it loses this strength, the strength comes from the network structures  

Ex: SiO2  
in actuality, each silicon in this compound binds to 4 different oxygens  
most likely caused by the fact it is in period 3, and thus more manipulation can happen  
SiO2 forms **network structure** with oxygen  

Ex: P4  
phosphorus also makes a covalent network structure, which increases the strength of the compound  

Ex: S8  
forms a covalent network structure, which improves the strength  

these covalent network structure were found as these compounds were found naturally by themselves (white and red phosphorus)  
these non-metals only exists on earth by themselves due to these covalent network structures  

# Sept. 17, 2024 

weak interacts with weak -> non-polar dissolves / interacts with non-polar, polar interacts with polar  
non-polar and polar will majority of the time, not interact or react  

## Oxidation State vs Charge
**oxidation state can equal to the charge or represent a different electron movement**  

Ex:  
oxidation state: +2, charge: 2+  

Ex: Fe3O4  
charge can not explain how there are 3 iron atoms  
use the *assumed* charge of oxygen (2-, not the observed 3- here), to calculate the oxidation states of iron and oxygen in this compound  

oxidation states should lign up with the charge as often as possible  

for the hydrogen peroxide family, oxygen *may* have a oxidation state of -1  

oxidation state tells us how many electrons an atom has "gained" or "lost" in a compound (even in covalent compounds)  
say carbon has an oxidation state of +2 in a covalent compound  
when carbon bonded with a different atom, even though they are sharing electrons, carbon "lost" more electrons than it gained in
that sharing of electrons, i.e. it "lost" 2 electrons

hydrogen is normally +1, unless it is bound to a group 1 metal, then it is a -1 charge  
oxygen is normally -2, unless it is part of a hydroxide (bound to a group 1 metal), then it becomes a -1 charge  

**when oxygen is bound to a halogen, in the chemical formula, write the halogen first**  
e.g. (F2O not OF2)  

# Sept. 18, 2024  

## Metallic Bonding and Strength

**alloy** - two metals mixed together  
not ionic or molecular, it is their own type  
metals must be liquids to form an alloy  

not all metals can mix together (like oil and water)  
alloys can be very weak, or very strong  
metals are normally strong, so weak alloys are normally never made  

steel (very strong alloy, iron corrodes too fast, and steel corrodes slower)  
carbon is very strong (highest melting point on the periodic table), and can be used in alloys  

strength comes from a smaller atomic radius  
elements nearing the end of a period get their shells more and more compressed (more protons get added, stronger attractional force)  
the smaller radius, the stronger  

the higher the cation charge, the stronger a metal  
transition metals can have very high positive charge  
free electrons (delocalized electrons) can form easiesr  
all metals want to **lose** electrons  

in an alloy, both metals want to release their electrons, creating delocalized electrons  
once cooled, the atoms are now *more* positive  
the free electrons are now attracted to the positive atoms  
the atoms and electrons do not want to bind, but they are attracted (recall the octet rule, everything wants to look like a noble gas)  

a **sea** of delocalized electrons is formed  
the cations and sea of delocalized electrons attract  
this forms a **layered system** (similar to a lattice structure)  

alloys are said to be malleable and have a high melting / boiling point  
they are mostly conductive in a solid or molten state  

as alloys are heated up, they start losing properties and become weaker and weaker  

factors for strength:  
- small atomic radius (normally stays higher up on the periodic table)  
- high cation charge (transition metals have a higher charge)  

## Bond Continuum (Bond Triangle)  
last way of looking at strength between ionic, polar, nonpolar, molecular compounds  
used with electronegativity values  

it is used to determine a compound's **properties**, not its type  

calculate the delta x (electronegativity) of the compound  
subtract the smaller number from the bigger number (electronegativity of a compound is found in the data booklet)  

then average out the electronegativity of the compound  

average is the x-axis  
delta x is the y-axis  

# Sept. 23, 2024 

## Organic Nomenclature
naming system based on number of carbons:  
1 - meth  
2 - eth  
3 - prop  
4 - but  
5 - pent  
6 - hex  
7 - hept  
8 - oct  
9 - non  
10 - dec  

functional groups cause a change to the suffix

### Alkane 
suffix is -ane  
**only single bonded carbons + hydrogens**  
Ex: CH4  

when naming, we look for the longest possible chain  
if something sits outside the longest chain, it is considered to be a side chain  

side chains have a suffix of '-yl'  
we must also provide a number for the location it is in  
must be the lowest position number   

if there are multiple side chains, they get written in alphabetical order - still with lowest position number for all of them  

maximize the length of the carbon chain  
the chain can bend, but not backtrack  

if there are multiple side chains that are of the same functional group, use covalent compound nomenclature to number the side chains  
Ex: 2,3-dimethyl hexane  

### Side Chain Isomers
in a side chain, when carbons attach to a 'centeral' carbon, not in a 'chain'  

propyl:  
- isopropyl  

butyl:  
- t-butyl  
- isobutyl 
- sec-butyl  

in the case of something like 6-isobutyl-4-t-butyl, sort alphabetically by prefix (this example is correct)
