## Energy
E = hƛ  

where E = energy, h = **planck's constant**, ƛ = wavelength  

h = 6.63 \* 10^(-34) J\*s

## Frequency and Wavelength
c = fƛ  

thus, E = (hc)/ƛ  

## Rydberg Equations
E = -R (1/nf^2 - 1/ni^2)  
1/ƛ = R (1/nf^2 - 1/ni^2)  

### Equation 1:
where E = energy, R = **Rydberg's constant** (note: there are two, one for each equation), nf = final energy level, ni = initial energy level  

R = 2.18 \* 10^(-18) J  

### Equation 2:
where ƛ = wavelength

R = 10973731.6 m^(-1)  

Note: 1m = 10^(9) nm  
nm -> m = multiply by 10^(-9)  
m -> nm = multiply by 10^(9)  

## Avogrado's Number
Convert a single particle to mole  

A = 6.022 \* 10^(23) particle / mol  

## Relative vs Actual Mass
All masses on the periodic table are divided by **1.66 * 10^(-24) g** to make math easier  

dividing by this constant makes hydrogen's mass 1 (as opposed to an extremely small number; note that this is *one atom* of hydrogen)
