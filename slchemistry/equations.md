## Energy
E = hf  

where E = energy, h = **planck's constant**, f = frequency   

h = 6.63 \* 10^(-34) J\*s

multiplying by avogrado's number gets the **ionization energy** for the first electron loss of an element  
final unit will be in J / mol  

## Frequency and Wavelength
c = fƛ  

thus, E = (hc)/ƛ  

Note: wavelength is given in m / nm and frequency is in hertz (hz)  

## Rydberg Equations
E = -R (1/nf^2 - 1/ni^2)  
1/ƛ = R (1/nf^2 - 1/ni^2)  

### Equation 1:
where E = energy, R = **Rydberg's constant** (note: there are two, one for each equation), nf = final energy level, ni = initial energy level  

R = 2.18 \* 10^(-18) J  

### Equation 2:
where ƛ = wavelength

R = 10973731.6 m^(-1)  

Note: 1m = 10^(9) nm  
nm -> m = multiply by 10^(-9)  
m -> nm = multiply by 10^(9)  

## Avogrado's Number
Convert a single particle to mole  

A = 6.022 \* 10^(23) particle / mol  

## Relative vs Actual Mass
All masses on the periodic table are multiplied by **1.66 * 10^(-24) g** to make math easier  

multiplying by this constant makes a mole of hydrogen to have a mass of 1 gram (as opposed to an extremely small number; note that this is *one mole* of hydrogen)  

Ex:  
an atom of hydrogen weighs \~1 amu (atomic mass units)  
atomic mass units is a **relative mass**  

multiplying by Avogrado's gives the weight of a mole of hydrogen in amu  (\~6.022 \* 10^23 amu)  

since this is difficult to work with, it is multipled by 1.66 * 10^(-24) g / amu to *convert* amu to grams 
(this converts the **relative mass** to the **actual mass** since the unit is grams, an "actual" scale)  

the resulting mass of a mole of hydrogen is \~1 g / mol (this is the **actual** mass)  

## Mole Equation
**n = N / N_a**  
n = moles (measured in mol)  
N = # of entities (measured by type of particle)   
N\_a = Avogrado's number (a constant)  

## Molar Mass
Ex: MgCl2  
M (molar mass) = 1Mg + 2Cl  
M = 24.31 \* 2(35.45)  
M = 95.21 g / mol  

n (moles) = m (mass in grams) / M (molar mass in g / mol)  

molar mass is treated as a **constant** in the equation (therefore it does not affect s.f. of the final answer)
