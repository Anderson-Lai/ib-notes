## Energy
E = hf  

where E = energy, h = **planck's constant**, f = frequency   

h = 6.63 \* 10^(-34) J\*s

multiplying by avogrado's number gets the **ionization energy** for the first electron loss of an element  
final unit will be in J / mol  

## Frequency and Wavelength
c = fƛ  

thus, E = (hc)/ƛ  

Note: wavelength is given in m / nm and frequency is in hertz (hz)  

## Rydberg Equations
E = R (1/nf^2 - 1/ni^2)  
1/ƛ = R (1/nf^2 - 1/ni^2)  

### Equation 1:
where E = energy, R = **Rydberg's constant** (note: there are two, one for each equation), nf = final energy level, ni = initial energy level  

R = 2.18 \* 10^(-18) J  

### Equation 2:
where ƛ = wavelength

R = 10973731.6 m^(-1)  

Note: 1m = 10^(9) nm  
nm -> m = multiply by 10^(-9)  
m -> nm = multiply by 10^(9)  

## Avogrado's Number
Convert a single particle to mole  

A = 6.022 \* 10^(23) particle / mol  

## Relative vs Actual Mass
All masses on the periodic table are multiplied by **1.66 * 10^(-24) g** to make math easier  

multiplying by this constant makes a mole of hydrogen to have a mass of 1 gram (as opposed to an extremely small number; note that this is *one mole* of hydrogen)  

Ex:  
an atom of hydrogen weighs \~1 amu (atomic mass units)  
atomic mass units is a **relative mass**  

multiplying by Avogrado's gives the weight of a mole of hydrogen in amu  (\~6.022 \* 10^23 amu)  

since this is difficult to work with, it is multipled by 1.66 * 10^(-24) g / amu to *convert* amu to grams 
(this converts the **relative mass** to the **actual mass** since the unit is grams, an "actual" scale)  

the resulting mass of a mole of hydrogen is \~1 g / mol (this is the **actual** mass)  

## Mole Equation
**n = N / N_a**  
n = moles (measured in mol)  
N = # of entities (measured by type of particle)   
N\_a = Avogrado's number (a constant)  

**note: amount of substance = number of moles**  

## Molar Mass
Ex: MgCl2  
M (molar mass) = 1Mg + 2Cl  
M = 24.31 \* 2(35.45)  
M = 95.21 g / mol  

n (moles) = m (mass in grams) / M (molar mass in g / mol)  

molar mass is treated as a **constant** in the equation (therefore it does not affect s.f. of the final answer)  

## Empirical to Molecular Formula
x = (molar mass of molecular formula) / (molar mass of empirical formula)  

x is the factor to multiply all the subscripts by to get the molecular formula  

x is always a whole number  
*if* there it is a real number, find the lowest factor to multiply it by to get a whole number (these are subscripts of atoms,
they can't be not whole numbers)  

## Molar Concentration 
c (concentration) = n / v  

c is in mol / dm^3 (dm^3 is the same as litres)  

1ml = 1cm^3  
1dm^3 = 1000cm^3 (10^3)  
1dm^3 = 1000ml  
1dm^3 = 1L  

mol / dm^3 is also shown as M  

n = moles  
v = volume (dm^3)  

[] = concentration  

## Dilutions
C1V1 = C2V2  
C1 is considered a stock solution (initial solution) it is from the producer  

solutions made by us would still be C1, but not a stock solution as the solution is *uncertain*  

C1 is initial concentration  
V1 is initial volume  
C2 is final concentration  
V2 is the final volume  

V2 - V1 is the amount of solvent (most of time water) added  

## PPM and PPB
ppm = mg (solute) / kg (total)  or mg / dm^3  

general formula = solute / total where total is in a unit 1,000,000 (for ppm) or 1,000,000,000 (for ppb) times bigger than the solute  

## Molar Volume
n = V (volume) / v (molar volume)  

v is a constant at STP  
v = 22.7 dm^3 / mol  

## Boyles Law
P is inversely proportional to V (assume temperature and moles are constant)  

P1V1 = P2V2  

## Charles Law
V is proportional to T (assuming pressure and moles are constant)  

V1/T1 = V2/T2  

## Guy - Lussac's Law
P is proportional to T (assuming volume and moles are constant)  

P1/T1 = P2/T2  

## Combined Gas Law 
assuming moles is constant  

P1V1 / T1 = P2V2 / T2  

## Ideal Gas Law 
pV = nRT  

R is a gas constant = 8.31 J/(K (kelvin) \* mol)  
p is pressure in kPa  
T is pressured in Kelvin
V is volume in dm^3  
n is moles in moles  

if all the units match, they can be safely canceled out  
**note: kPa \* dm^3 = J**  

## Percentage Yield
used to calculate how much of a precipitate or gas has been formed on the product side  
if mole ratios are needed, remember to use the coefficient of the **limiting factor**  

percentage yield = (experimental yield / theoretical yield) \* 100  

## Reaction Statistics
remaining = have - need  

used = have - remaining  
used = need  

## Atom Economy
brief look at **green chemistry**  
green chemistry - running a reaciton to limit waste or increase desired yield to reduce the use of toxic chemicals  

atom economy = (molar mass of desired product) / (total molar mass of products or reactants) \* 100  

a balanced chemical reaction is needed as the **coefficients** will be used as well  

actual result is -(10 - 15)% due to real-world factors, inefficient reactions, etc.  

## Calculating Heat 
Q = mcΔT  
Q = heat (kJ or J)  
m = mass (g or kg)  
c = specific heat capacity (J g^-1 K^-1)  
ΔT = change in temperature (K)  

## Calculating Enthalpy
ΔH = -Q / n  
enthalpy = kJ / mol  
Q = heat  
n = moles  

if the answer is negative, it is an **exothermic reaction**  
if the answer is positive, it is an **endothermic reaction**  

amount of energy **gained / lost** *during* the reaction  

## Bond Enthalpy
ΔH = Σ(bond energy of bonds broken) - Σ(bond energy of bonds formed)  

the coefficient of the specified compound should be **1**, as the bond enthalpy is in reference to one mole  

## Enthalpy of Formation
ΔH = ΣΔH\_products - ΣΔH\_reactants  
(products - reactants)  
remember to **include coefficients**
