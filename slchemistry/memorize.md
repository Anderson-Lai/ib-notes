## Isomers
propyl:  
- isopropyl  

butyl:  
- isobutyl  
- t-butyl  
- sec-butyl  

## Halogens as Side Chains  
chlorine - chloro  
fluorine - fluoro  
bromine - bromo  
iodine - iodo  

## Special Prefixes 
cyclo - carbon chain "loop around"  
this prefix **does** count to alphabetical ordering

## Special Suffixes 
for small compounds that do not include a number, add an 'an' before the suffix  
alcohol - ol -> anol  
aldehyde - al -> anal  
ketone - one -> anone  

## Special Compounds 
cyclohex-1,3,5-triene is known as **benzene**  
benzene as a side chain is called **phenyl**  

benzene + 1 OH = phenol  
benzene + 2 or more OH = benzene-1,2,...-[prefix]ol  

## Functional Group Priority
carboxylic acid > ester > amide > aldehyde > ketone > ether > alcohol > amine > alkyne > alkene > alkane  

## Functional Group Suffixes
alkane - 'ane' has a single carbon bond   
alkene - 'ene' has a double carbon bond  
alkyne - 'yne' has a triple carbon bond   
alcohol - 'ol' has a OH (hydroxide)   
ether - side chain has the suffix 'oxy' has a \~C-O-C~  
aldehyde - 'anal' comes first in the parent chain has a H-C=O at the beginning of the compound  
ketone - 'one' has a C=O in the **middle** of the compound
