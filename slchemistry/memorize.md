# Intermolecular Forces

hydrogen bonds - hydrogen from one compound forms dipoles with N, O, or F  
dipole-dipole - dipoles between different compounds in a solid  
induced-dipole - temporary dipoles between compounds in a liquid / gas  
London dispersion force (LDF) - attraction between temporary dipoles (very similar to induced-dipoles)

- isobutyl  
- t-butyl  
- sec-butyl  

## Halogens as Side Chains  
chlorine - chloro  
fluorine - fluoro  
bromine - bromo  
iodine - iodo  

## Special Prefixes 
cyclo - carbon chain "loop around"  
this prefix **does** count to alphabetical ordering

## Special Suffixes 
for small compounds that do not include a number, add an 'an' before the suffix  
alcohol - ol -> anol  
aldehyde - al -> anal  
ketone - one -> anone  

## Special Compounds 
cyclohex-1,3,5-triene is known as **benzene**  
benzene as a side chain is called **phenyl**  

benzene + 1 OH = phenol  
benzene + 2 or more OH = benzene-1,2,...-[prefix]ol  

## Functional Group Priority
carboxylic acid > ester > amide > aldehyde > ketone > ether > alcohol > amine > alkyne > alkene > alkane  

## Functional Group Suffixes
alkane - 'ane' has a single carbon bond   
alkene - 'ene' has a double carbon bond  
alkyne - 'yne' has a triple carbon bond   
alcohol - 'ol' has a OH (hydroxide)   
ether - side chain has the suffix 'oxy' has a \~C-O-C~  
aldehyde - 'anal' comes first in the parent chain has a H-C=O at the beginning of the compound  
ketone - 'one' has a C=O in the **middle** of the compound  
carboxylic acid - 'oic' has OH-C=O at the start of compound  
ester - 'oate' has O-C=O, parent chain starts with the C=O carbon  
amide - 'amide' has a N-C=O, parent chain starts with the C=O carbon  
amine - 'amine' has N-C, parent chain is the longest carbon chain  

# Reactions

## Synthesis
A + B -> AB
must be the same element for it to be synthesis and not single-displacement  

synthesis - produces one compound  

SiCl4 + Cl2 -> no RxN  
although silicon is in period 3 and can have an expanded octet, there is no space for the new chlorines  

**non-metal oxides + water -> acids**  
N2O3 + H2O -> 2HNO2 (ternary acid, there are three elements)  

**metal oxides + water -> base** (metal + hydroxide)  
MgO + H2O -> Mg(OH)2  

## Decomposition
AB -> A + B  

**metal nitrate -> metal nitrite + oxygen gas**  
Ca(NO3)2 -> Ca(NO2)2 + O2  

**metal carbonate -> metal oxide + carbon dioxide**  
Al2(CO3)3 -> AlO3 + CO2  

**metal bicarbonate -> metal oxide + water + carbon dioxide**  
2NaHCO3 -> Na2O + H2O + 2CO2  

**metal hydroxide -> metal oxide + water**  
2LiOH -> Li2O + H2O  

**metal chlorate -> metal chloride + oxygen gas**  
Be(ClO3)2 -> BeCl2 + 3/2 O2  

## Single Displacement
If A is a metal  
A + BC -> AC + B  

need to refer to an activity series to verify that A can displace B  

If A is a nonmetal  
A + BC -> BA + C  

If A and C are halogens we use the activity series of halogens; shown on periodic table  
F > Cl > Br > I  

## Double Displacement
AB + CD -> AD + CB  

NH4OH -> NH3 + H2O  
H2CO3 -> CO2 + H2O  

## Combustion
organic compound + oxygen gas  
complete combustion has excess oxygen + produces only CO2 and H2O  
if the organic compound contains nitrogen it also produces NO2  

incomplete combustion has limited oxygen + produces a variety of possible products:  
- CO2
- H2O
- CO
- C 
- H2 

complete combustion burns clean, producing white smoke  
incomplete combustion produces black / grey smoke  

elements + oxygen that yield energy can be both synthesis *and* combustion  

when balancing, assume complete combustion, as incomplete combustion yields random products
