"childrens, scions of the ancient Cadmean line"  
Thebes began through the Cadmean line  
Cadmus killed a dragon, sowed its teeth, and armed men sprang up and fought each other until 5 people remained, and helped Cadmus build the city  

Thebes' population is comprised of the descendants of Cadmus or directly from the dragon  
**theme: civilization vs savagery**  

sorrowful tone and mood, the population needs to be rescued and saved  

## Devices 
irony: "i come to see it with my eyes" (sight imagery), ironic, as Oedipus lacks insight  
"no messenger's", ironic, as at the end of the play, it is the messenger who gives the information needed to find the culprit (himself)  
foreshadows the end of the play (typical in a prologue)  
Oedipus is thus not really seeing the truth, ironic, as it is the king's responsibility to do that  

Pallas is the surname of Athena (allusion), goddess of power and wisdom, preserves and maintains order of the state  
Ismenus - a small river  

"look upon the city, see the storm" - pathetic fallacy  
pathetic fallacy produces disease imagery, showing the state of the land  

Oedipus is acting arrogant and like a god  
saved Thebes once, the people come to him to ask him to save Thebes again  

Oedipus does have worldly knowledge (as he solved the riddle of the Sphinx), but lacks self-knowledge  
dramatic irony: we know that he is not the best of men for this job, but the people of Thebes nor does Oedipus know that  

Oedipus is a hero because he has already acted, he does not hesistate  
"i know too well, you all are sick, yet sick, not so sick as i" - archetype of 3 (is important)  
ironic as he is causing the sickness, 3 means unity, completeness (in this context), or power  
Oedipus has completed the cycle of 3  

"... or I am damned" - ironic as Oedipus is already damned  

Apollo represents the god of light and truth  
Oedipus equates himself with the gods, as he believes he can see the truth as well  
"i come to see it with my eyes", "apollo's eyes are bright" - light motif associated with Apollo  
Oedipus believes he can see the truth as well as Apollo, he is ignorant  

**motif: sight imagery**  
**light: represent truth**  
**darkness: hiding, lying**  

just because you can see, does not mean you can see the truth (many of the priests are blind)  

**paradox - "you leave me half in hope, half buried in despair"**  

Creon blames Oedipus  
Oedipus banishes himself, showing he is still loyal to the gods  
Oedipus purges himself from the "body politic"  
"blood for blood" - foreshadows the end (Oedipus should be killed)  

"a man i never saw \[the king]" - Oedipus (ironic, as he killed the king)  

Oedipus becomes the detectives and interrogates Creon  
(ironic, as he is the murderer)  

the one person Oedipus spared said a whole group attacked the previous king  
Oedipus holds on to the fact that he was alone when he killed a man (the previous king)  
this one piece of misinformation delays the discovery  
the shepherd intentionally gives this piece of misinformation as he knows the murdered is Oedipus, and he does not want to be the one to take 
down the king  

no one really investigated the king's murder  

foreshadows the end, where he enacts his own punishment on himself  

Oedipus is heroic as he is duty-bound, vows to do anything to find the truth (has many redeeming qualities, causing the audience to pity him)  
said he is even willing to turn his own hands on himself, but he does not believe that he is the murderer  

ode goes from hopeful to a prayer for help (asking the gods for help)  

## Chorus 
voice of the community  
appeal to the gods  
dramatic and musical performance  
interprets events of the play, gives a commentary  
became the "ideal" spectators  
reflected upon what happened, and pondered what will happen

## Fate, Freedom, and the Tragic Experience
universe does not operate by chance, someone or something is in control  
Jocasta believes in chance (opposes the gods), and tries to impose it on Oedipus  

to not believe in fate is to be an atheist (of sort)  

**fatalism** - controlling forces of the world are much more mysterious and powerful than we can imagine  
free will still exists, it is your choice how to face your own destiny  

a hero is *willing to act*  
Oedipus tries to thwart his fate, but the audience knows he has not  

Oedipus' name (swollen feet) is a constant reminder of the ironic tension of the play  
tension builds as he insists it was not him who killed the king at a road junction  

Jocasta knows about the truth, and wants Oedipus to stop seeking the truth (ignorance is bliss)  
Oedipus is innocent and naive, and does not deserve his fate  

**fate punishes arbitrarily and mercilessly those who choose to confront the mystery**

## Episode 1
Oedipus plays the role of a good king, saying he would enact his punishments on himself if he finds himself an accomplice  
Oedipus would punish himself if he were the murderer (ironic and foreshadows the end of the play)  

Oedipus still believes in fate at this point (asks the gods to reveal the killer)  

Oedipus' tone changes, and uses oppressive language  
his flaw of arrogance is showing  

Tiresias is a blind prophet, he knows the truth of the murderer  
he wants to leave, and wants to spare Oedipus  

Tiresias does not want to reveal the truth  
Oedipus keeps pushing him for more information  

Oedipus lacks self-knolwedge and can not see the truth  
Oedipus blames the murder on Tiresias  
Tiresias reveals his knowledge, and tells Oedipus that he is the murderer  

Oedipus has committed patricide and incest (the worst crimes in greece)  
Apollo invoked this fate, not Oedipus  

Oedipus remembers it was Creon who insisted he find Tiresias, and believes that Creon is involved with the murder  
Oedipus thinks Tiresias made up this story, and this is not from the gods  

scene ends with Tiresias foreshadowing Oedipus' end  

tragedy of character not a tragedy of fate, as it is Oedipus confronting his mystery  

Tiresias highlights the dramatic irony - he is blind but he can see the truth  
Oedipus' knowledge can not help him as he is devoid of self-knolwedge  

people in Plato's 'cave' rather live in darkness and in lies than confront reality and the truth  
(Oedipus cannot see the truth of himself)  

Tiresias revelas aspects of Oedipus' character that have not yet ben revealed (arrogance)

## Second Choral Ode 
chorus suggests that man could deny fate  
Sophocles debated this throughout the play  

can man thwart the gods and fate?  
"But oh among men where is there proof  
That a prophet can know  
More than me, a man?" (page 28)  

chorus echos the thought of innocence until proven guilty  
Oedipus wants to find out the truth, but the truth will bite him  
Oedipus is true to himself in that sense, and wants to discover the guilty person  
Oedipus is courageous enough that if he is the killer, he is willing to accept that and the punishment it entails  

## Mount Kithairon
looming image ever present in Oedipus' rational search for self-identity
dangerous climb to a place of disclosure  
is a dramatic metaphor that represents it is impossible for man to be like a god  

## Episode 2 
Oedipus curses Creon of plotting against him  
Oedipus' hubris (execessive pride) is highlighted as he wants to kill Creon  
Oedipus thinks Creon is speaking through Tiresias, and that Creon is the real killer  

Jocasta is a catalyst, and is leading Oedipus away from the truth  
tells Oedipus to ignore Tiresias, and says the gods have no reverence  
Jocasta believes in chacne (not fate)  
Jocasta is derailing Oedipus from discovering the truth
