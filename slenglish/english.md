"childrens, scions of the ancient Cadmean line"  
Thebes began through the Cadmean line  
Cadmus killed a dragon, sowed its teeth, and armed men sprang up and fought each other until 5 people remained, and helped Cadmus build the city  

Thebes' population is comprised of the descendants of Cadmus or directly from the dragon  
**theme: civilization vs savagery**  

sorrowful tone and mood, the population needs to be rescued and saved  

## Devices 
irony: "i come to see it with my eyes" (sight imagery), ironic, as Oedipus lacks insight  
"no messenger's", ironic, as at the end of the play, it is the messenger who gives the information needed to find the culprit (himself)  
foreshadows the end of the play (typical in a prologue)  
Oedipus is thus not really seeing the truth, ironic, as it is the king's responsibility to do that  

Pallas is the surname of Athena (allusion), goddess of power and wisdom, preserves and maintains order of the state  
Ismenus - a small river  

"look upon the city, see the storm" - pathetic fallacy  
pathetic fallacy produces disease imagery, showing the state of the land  

Oedipus is acting arrogant and like a god  
saved Thebes once, the people come to him to ask him to save Thebes again  

Oedipus does have worldly knowledge (as he solved the riddle of the Sphinx), but lacks self-knowledge  
dramatic irony: we know that he is not the best of men for this job, but the people of Thebes nor does Oedipus know that  

Oedipus is a hero because he has already acted, he does not hesistate  
"i know too well, you all are sick, yet sick, not so sick as i" - archetype of 3 (is important)  
ironic as he is causing the sickness, 3 means unity, completeness (in this context), or power  
Oedipus has completed the cycle of 3  

"... or I am damned" - ironic as Oedipus is already damned  

Apollo represents the god of light and truth  
Oedipus equates himself with the gods, as he believes he can see the truth as well  
"i come to see it with my eyes", "apollo's eyes are bright" - light motif associated with Apollo  
Oedipus believes he can see the truth as well as Apollo, he is ignorant  

**motif: sight imagery**  
**light: represent truth**  
**darkness: hiding, lying**  

just because you can see, does not mean you can see the truth (many of the priests are blind)  

**paradox - "you leave me half in hope, half buried in despair"**  

Creon blames Oedipus  
Oedipus banishes himself, showing he is still loyal to the gods  
Oedipus purges himself from the "body politic"  
"blood for blood" - foreshadows the end (Oedipus should be killed)  

"a man i never saw \[the king]" - Oedipus (ironic, as he killed the king)  

Oedipus becomes the detectives and interrogates Creon  
(ironic, as he is the murderer)  

the one person Oedipus spared said a whole group attacked the previous king  
Oedipus holds on to the fact that he was alone when he killed a man (the previous king)  
this one piece of misinformation delays the discovery  
the shepherd intentionally gives this piece of misinformation as he knows the murdered is Oedipus, and he does not want to be the one to take 
down the king  

no one really investigated the king's murder  

foreshadows the end, where he enacts his own punishment on himself  

Oedipus is heroic as he is duty-bound, vows to do anything to find the truth (has many redeeming qualities, causing the audience to pity him)  
said he is even willing to turn his own hands on himself, but he does not believe that he is the murderer  

ode goes from hopeful to a prayer for help (asking the gods for help)  

## Chorus 
voice of the community  
appeal to the gods  
dramatic and musical performance  
interprets events of the play, gives a commentary  
became the "ideal" spectators  
reflected upon what happened, and pondered what will happen  

# Sept. 12, 2024 

## Fate, Freedom, and the Tragic Experience
universe does not operate by chance, someone or something is in control  
Jocasta believes in chance (opposes the gods), and tries to impose it on Oedipus  

to not believe in fate is to be an atheist (of sort)  

**fatalism** - controlling forces of the world are much more mysterious and powerful than we can imagine  
free will still exists, it is your choice how to face your own destiny  

a hero is *willing to act*  
Oedipus tries to thwart his fate, but the audience knows he has not  

Oedipus' name (swollen feet) is a constant reminder of the ironic tension of the play  
tension builds as he insists it was not him who killed the king at a road junction  

Jocasta knows about the truth, and wants Oedipus to stop seeking the truth (ignorance is bliss)  
Oedipus is innocent and naive, and does not deserve his fate  

**fate punishes arbitrarily and mercilessly those who choose to confront the mystery**

## Episode 1
Oedipus plays the role of a good king, saying he would enact his punishments on himself if he finds himself an accomplice  
Oedipus would punish himself if he were the murderer (ironic and foreshadows the end of the play)  

Oedipus still believes in fate at this point (asks the gods to reveal the killer)  

Oedipus' tone changes, and uses oppressive language  
his flaw of arrogance is showing  

Tiresias is a blind prophet, he knows the truth of the murderer  
he wants to leave, and wants to spare Oedipus  

Tiresias does not want to reveal the truth  
Oedipus keeps pushing him for more information  

Oedipus lacks self-knolwedge and can not see the truth  
Oedipus blames the murder on Tiresias  
Tiresias reveals his knowledge, and tells Oedipus that he is the murderer  

Oedipus has committed patricide and incest (the worst crimes in greece)  
Apollo invoked this fate, not Oedipus  

Oedipus remembers it was Creon who insisted he find Tiresias, and believes that Creon is involved with the murder  
Oedipus thinks Tiresias made up this story, and this is not from the gods  

scene ends with Tiresias foreshadowing Oedipus' end  

tragedy of character not a tragedy of fate, as it is Oedipus confronting his mystery  

Tiresias highlights the dramatic irony - he is blind but he can see the truth  
Oedipus' knowledge can not help him as he is devoid of self-knolwedge  

people in Plato's 'cave' rather live in darkness and in lies than confront reality and the truth  
(Oedipus cannot see the truth of himself)  

Tiresias revelas aspects of Oedipus' character that have not yet ben revealed (arrogance)  

# Sept. 19, 2024

## Second Choral Ode 
chorus suggests that man could deny fate  
Sophocles debated this throughout the play  

can man thwart the gods and fate?  
"But oh among men where is there proof  
That a prophet can know  
More than me, a man?" (page 28)  

chorus echos the thought of innocence until proven guilty  
Oedipus wants to find out the truth, but the truth will bite him  
Oedipus is true to himself in that sense, and wants to discover the guilty person  
Oedipus is courageous enough that if he is the killer, he is willing to accept that and the punishment it entails  

## Mount Kithairon
looming image ever present in Oedipus' rational search for self-identity
dangerous climb to a place of disclosure  
is a dramatic metaphor that represents it is impossible for man to be like a god  

## Episode 2 
Oedipus curses Creon of plotting against him  
Oedipus' hubris (execessive pride) is highlighted as he wants to kill Creon  
Oedipus thinks Creon is speaking through Tiresias, and that Creon is the real killer  

Jocasta is a catalyst, and is leading Oedipus away from the truth  
tells Oedipus to ignore Tiresias, and says the gods have no reverence  
Jocasta believes in chacne (not fate)  
Jocasta is derailing Oedipus from discovering the truth  

# Sept. 20, 2024 

## Episode 2 (cont.)
a catalyst precipitates change, leading Oedipus away from his path of self discovery  
Jocasta tells Oedipus that her son had "his ankles riveted together" (page 40), ironic, as Oedipus' name means swollen foot
Jocasta tells Oedipus Laius was murdered by a group of people, not one person  
told Oedipus that her son (Oedipus), is dead, as he was left on Mount Kithairon when he was 3 days old  

*ironic*, as Jocasta does not know she is talking to his son  
Jocasta does not want Oedipus to find the truth, wants someone else to find the truth  
Jocasta her "killing" of Oedipus thwarted fate, and thus they no longer need to believe in fate  

Jocasta uses the number **3** constantly  
crossway of 3, abandoned her son when he was 3 days old, etc.  
Oedipus becomes the archetype of the number 3 -> becomes the archetype of the tragic man  

**the number 3 means completeness, closure, unity, and spiritual awareness**, 3 is used throughout this play  

Oedipus does not believe what Jocasta tells him, he is a believer in fate  
Oedipus begins to fear that he did kill Laius  

Oedipus admits his self-ignorance, as he relizes all the facts begin to line up  

the shepherd, the only person who survived Laius' murder, asks Jocasta to leave the moment he sees Oedipus  
knew it would unravel Oedipus' life, and did not want to be the one to do that  
the shepherd was lying, as he was the one who told Jocasta it was a band of brigands  

Oedipus wants the shepherd to come  

Oedipus' adopted parents never told him he was adopted, but the whole town knew  
Oedipus leaves Corinth to avoid his fate as given by the Oracle of Delphi, as he still believes his adopted parents are his real parents  
Oedipus begins to realise that Laius is his *real* father  

a reversal of actions leads to revelation, creating a united plot (textbook, "perfect", Greek tragedy)  

Oedipus is being very rational even in a time of despair  
he is holding on to the fact that the shepherd said a *band* of people killing Laius, not one person (Oedipus)  

## Third Chorale Ode 
the chorus announces the world is controlled by fate, and the chorus says a man can not triumph over the gods  
ironic, as Oedipus has just began to agree with Jocasta's belief in chance  
however, the chorus states that if man can thwart fate, the gods are not in control  
shows Sophocles' debate between whether man has control over his own destiny  

Jocasta defies the gods, but prays to them  
she now appeals to them for help, as she realizes Oedipus is the killer of Laius  
Jocasta already knows the truth, and that the shepherd is a liar  

Jocasta is now aware of the truth  

a messenger tells Jocasta that the King of Corinth (who she believes is Oedipus' real father) has died  
Jocasta goes back to defying fate, and believes in chance once again  
Jocasta believes this is good news  

Oedipus thinks his real father (Polybus), has died  
Oedipus agrees with Jocasta, and stops believing in fate  
Oedipus keeps switching between believing and defying fate  
shows Sophocles' debate whether or not man should be controlled by fate  

Jocasta does know the truth, but wants to live in ignorance  

Oedipus is still concerned that although Laius has been killed, the second part of the prophecy says he will mary his mother  
in those times, marying your mother as a ruler was a "good" thing, as the mother was viewed as the "mother of the nation"  
Jocasta reminds Oedipus of that to try to calm him down, ironic, as he is acting like his mother  

the messenger tells Oedipus that Polybus is not his real father  
messenger tells Oedipus that he delivered Oedipus to Polybus as a gift  
messenger tells Oedipus that he was discovered at Mount Kithairon  

Mount Kithairon is used to display the dramatic irony  

Jocasta runs away and has gone pale  
she has realized the truth  

Jocasta hides her face in her hands, she is ashamed  
juxtaposition of truth and deception  

Jocasta knows the truth, but is trying to stop the truth from coming out  
Oedipus insists to find the truth  

Jocasta is shackling herself to Oedipus to keep him in the cave (so that he does not see the truth and stays in a 'cave' of delusion)  
Oedipus wants to stay true to himself  
Jocasta tells Oedipus to deceive himself  
shows **Plato's cave allegory**  

moons -> constantly changes (different phases)  
Oedipus compares himself to a moon, he is constanlty switching between the phases of accepting the truth  

Oedipus experiences:
- fame, yet shame
- sight, but blindness; Oedipus can not see the full truth
- his intellect is his greatest strength, yet causes his downfall
- ignorance and insight  

Jocasta is the only person who sees the full truth right now  
she can not bear to accept the truth, and thus goes to hang herself

## Episode 4
"Lost! Ah lost! At last it's blazing clear.  
Light of my days, go dark. I want to gaze no more.  
My birth all sprung revealed from those it never should,  
Myself entwined with those I never could.  
And I the killer of those I never would." - Oedipus sees the truth  
page (67)  

foreshadows Oedipus will gouge out his eyes  

reversal of actions leads -> revelation -> unity of plot (there are a bunch of greek words for this)  
Oedipus realizes he has committed patricide and incest  

## Episode 5 
page 70 - the denoument  
shows Oedipus' punishment  

in Greek culture, to see meant to see only false appearances (lacked insight)  
to be blind, it meant to see the truth and have prophetic vision  

Oedipus realized he lacked insight, wanted to be blind to have prophetic vision to "see" the truth  
metaphorical death of Oedipus  
Oedipus banishes himself, but does not kill himself  
to live a life of suffering, and to not be able to see his family, is his "death"  

"rips from off her dress  
the golden brooches she was wearing,  
Holds them up and rams the pins right through his eyes.  
'Wicked, Wicked eyes!' he gasps,  
'You shall not see me nor my crime,'  
not see my present shame.  
Go dark for all time blind  
to what you never should have seen, and blind  
to the love this heart has cried to see." (page 70)  

"Oh, the pity and the horror" - catharsis  
the chorus is the audience now  

Oedipus joins the chorus  
shows his fall from greatness  
uses lots of dark imagery to show his descent  

Oedipus echoes that fate can not be avoided  
this is the answer to Sophocles' debate  

"Friends, it was Apollo, spirit of Apollo.  
He made this evil fructify." - Oedipus' reversal back to believing in fate  
(page 73)  

Oedipus reverts back to believing in fate after somewhat believing in chance because of Jocasta  

"Yes, rot that man's unlocking my feet from biting fetters.  
Unloosing me from murder to lock me in a blood-love.  
Had I only died then, I should not now be leaving  
All I love and mine so sadly shattered." - pity for Oedipus  
(page 73)  

Oedipus shows courage even after all this  
willing to live a "living death" for the sake of "prophetic vision" from being blind  

Oedipus wants to be banished to the hills of Mount Kithairon  
ironic, as his "living death" will be where his death was supposed to be  

asks Creon to take care of his daughters  

Oedipus admits he lived in blindness, and lacked self-knowledge  
Oedipus wants his daughters to live in modesty (opposite of his arrogance)  

Creon tells Oedipus all that he had was wordly knowledge, and no self-konwledge  
"Stop this striving to be master of all.  
The mastery you had in life has been your fall." (page 80)  

Oedipus strived for the wrong thing, only worldly knowledge and no self-knowledge  

Oedipus had wordly knowledge, and was on a pedestal, but fell from the pedestal as he lacked self-knowledge  
chorus warns the audience about fate and fortune  
you do not know your happiness until your death and you can look back  

Oedipus' overconfidence, lack of self-knowledge, and arrogance leads to his fate  
you can be forgiven for a bad fate, but not for flaws  
thus, this play is the a tragedy of character  

# Oct. 9, 2024 - Penelopiad

a story about divisions is itself divided  
the maids interrupt penelope's narrative  

is penelope a reliable narrator?  

mythical vs mundane  
ancient vs modern  
public vs hidden  
spoken vs silenced  

## Mundane vs Mythical
drunken crew vs fighting cyclops  

maids are the classical chorus  
maids are also like a modern variety show  

tension between mundane and mythical  
penelope does not know which story is true  

## Ancient vs Modern
contrasting descriptions of Helen  

ancient - semi-divine, "perfect" Greek wife  
modern - questions divinity, "stuck-up"  

the myth is so powerful it retains it power in modern language  
penelope speaks the myth in modern language to make her seem approachable  

most of penelope's stories are not her own, they are about Odysseus  

does not know why her father tried to drown her  
story is told literally, but penelope can not fill in the entire story as even she does not know the truth  
tries to make her father's actions intelligible by guessing  
makes her human and approachable  

penelope is much more like a memoir than the classic epic  

## Spoken vs Silenced
she has no mouth to speak from, and no one across the River Styx wants to listen to her  
she has no body to gesture with  
no one wants to listen to her as she is dead  
an audience must be willing to listen  

penelope is trying to challenge an audience from Homer that has been passed through the generations orally

# Oct. 15, 2024

## Spoken vs Silenced
revision of her story from death  

odyssues is much older and portrayed as a father  
how can penelope know she can trust odysseus as he has all the power in their relationship  

## Truth and Silence
maids speak amongst themselves that they could have killed Telemachus as a child  
maids spend a long time on the **boat imagery** (where they were hanged)  

## Symbols
Boat is a metaphor for the journey of yourself  
how sturdy is the boat?  
what dangers do we face in the water?  
do we hvae help to repair it when the boat gets damanged?  

the maids symbolic overthrow of a matriarchal society by a patriarchal society  
maids are both a symbol and real people  

## Themes
falsehoods (truth and deception) - can you trust the narrator to give all the information?  
storytelling - the person holding power changes depending on the narrator  

class, womanhood (gender), and violence - depending on class / gender you may be oppressed or there may be violence against you  

antiquity and the modernity and progress of women (patriarchy and feminism) - women don't "own" the narrative  

Christianity vs Greek gods - addition of Christian hell imagery into Greek hell  
repentance and sin (free choice) vs a prescribed destiny (Greek theology)  

the maids' death - the patriarchy is overthrowing the female-focused goddess cults, 12 maids + Penelope for the 13 lunar months; Odysseus' return
symbolizes the male-centric religion hijacked the women-centric religion (Artemis and the moon), however, this interpretation causes the maids to 
be treated as objects instead of real people  

water - associated with womanhood / motherhood  

boat imagery - journey of life, Artemis, the moon traveling across the sky  

## Story
Penelope goes to the field of asphodel, where neither the good nor evil reside (connection back to falsehoods / storytelling theme)
