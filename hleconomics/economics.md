# Sept. 4, 2024 - Intro to Economics  
  
Economics is a social science, i.e., it uses the scientific method to learn more about human interaction and society  
  
## Scarcity  
Economics is the study of choices on scarce resources, as human wants are infinite, but available resources are finite  
  
## Factors of Production  
- Land (gifts of nature)  
- Labour  
- Capital (manmade resources to boost production)  
- Entrepreneurship (innovate by developing new ways of doing things; takes on risk of success or failure of a business)  
  
## Other meanings of 'capital'  
- Physical (one of the factors of production)  
- Human (skills acquired by people -> more productivity)  
- Natural (expnds the factor of production 'land', necessary for human survival and opportunity)  
- Financial (investments and purchases of financial instruments, i.e. stocks and bonds)  
  
## Opportunity Cost  
exists as resources, like time and money, are scarce    
the value of the best altnerative that was given up to obtain something else    
  
## Free and Economic Goods  
free good - a good that is not scarce, and thus has an opportunity cost of 0    
  
economic good - a good that is scarce, either because it itself is a naturally scarce resource, or because it is produced by scarce resources    
as a result, all economic goods have an opportunity cost greater than 0    
  
a free good for one may be an economic good for another (clean air, airable soil)    
  
## Free good vs a good free of charge  
natural resources (known as a common pool resource) are free of a charge, but are an economic resource because they are scarce,  
and are becoming more scarce due to overuse and depletion    
  
services provided by the government are seemingly "free", but are produced by scarce resources, funded by tax revenues  
  
# Sept. 5, 2024 - What is Economics?

how to supply our wants with our limited resources?  
how do we allocate our resources efficiently and sustainably?  

main questions:
- what items, products, goods, or services to produce over others?
- how should we produce these items?
- for whom do we produce these items, and how much of said item do we give them?

Canada has a mixed market economy (partly controlled by the government and sellers)

characteristics:
- has a market and prices
- government influence
- control of what to put into the market

goals:
- income is distributed
- employ all available resources
- everyone is mostly employed 

## 9 key concepts:
- scarcity (how can resources be best used to satisfy wants and needs)
- choice (we need to choose what to produce, and what products are more important)
- efficiency (do not waste our limited resources, and fully employ our resources)
- equity (equally distributing income, wealth, and opportunity)
- economic well-being (health of economy enjoyed by the people)
- sustainability (using our resources wisely to not harm the opportunities of the future generations)
- change (understanding that the economic world is very fluid and is constantly in motion, our method of thinking must change on the situtation)
- interdependence (we are not self sufficient, and must rely on one another)
- intervention (government involvement in the working market)

## Scarcity and Choice
smart choices are needed to choose what to prioritize over the other, due to the limited nature of resources  

scaricty arises from limited money, time, and energy  
economics is the study of the choices leading to the best use of scarce resources to fulfill unlimited human wants and needs  

for society, all economic resources are scarce  
these resources come from human soceity and nature  

economic development is often achieved at the expense of the environment and natural resources  
overuse of these practices lead is unsustainable  

sustainability - using resources to produce goods whilst not making the resources any more scarce  

## Factors of Production  
- Land 
- Labour 
- Capital  
- Entrepreneurship  

Land - 'gifts of nature' used to produce goods  
resources may not be renewable, or take a long time to renew (sustainability)

labour - the work, time, and effort put into creating goods or services  
quality of labour (human capital) - the knowledge needed to provide a service or create a good  

capital - any machines, tools, instruments, or buildings used to create good and services  
we humans can not create everything by ourselves  

entrepreneurship - the human resources that organizes land, labour, and capital to produce goods and services  

these factors cause our resources, goods, and services to be scarce  

## 3 Economic Questions
- what
- how
- for whom 

### What do we produce first?  
how do we make said produce or provide a service? (do we need machines, human labour, money, or labour?)  

Resources Allocation - allocating resources properly to provide a good or service  
a change in the quantity of goods produced will involve a reallocation of resources (resources are limited)  

when a society produces too much of a good or service that is an overallocation of resources  

### What to produce?
objects that people value and products that satifies wants  
reallocation of resources will be needed (less farmers in Canada over the past 60 years)

what resources do we need to produce this product?  

### For whom to proudce?  
an economic goal is distributing goods equally (does not always happen)
how will goods and services be distributed to the population?

## Opportunity Cost and Production
the expected value of the best altnerative  
all human choices require cost and tradeoff  
every good a nation produces faces a tradeoff of a good it can no longer produce  
how much of each product is a nation willing to produce to maximize its resources (guns and butter)  

## Making Economic Choices 
market vs command method  
- market (private companies making decisions)
- command (government makes the choices and not the businesses)

## Resource Allocation and Output/Input Distribution 
3 main questions are forced by scarcity:
- what/how much to produce 
- how to produce (machine to labour ratio, which technologies, which materials, what skills)
- produce for whom? (equality vs earned, should certain services/goods be distributed more evenly)

**What/How to produce -> resource Allocation**  
**Whom to produce -> distribution of output and income**  

## Resource Allocation 
assigning available resources or factors of production to specific uses amongst altneratives  
what is produced, and how much is produced  
if a change in the number of goods produced is made a reallocation is required (overallocation vs underallocation)  

## Distribution of Output
how much of the produced goods do certain individuals or groups receive  
related to **distribution of income**  
amount people can buy is directly related to how much income they have  
**Redistribution of income** - when social groups receive more, less, or input/output less than previously

## Free Market Economy, Planned Economy, Mixed Economy 
real world economies normally mix free market and planned economies (mixed economies)  

### Resource ownership: public vs private sector
public sector - government owned and controlled  
private sector - owned by individuals, businesses, non-government organizations  

free market economy - private sector resource ownership  
planned economy - public sector resource ownership  

### Economic decision-making  
what and how much is produced, for whom is something produced?  

free market - private sector determines the answers to these questions  
planned economy - government determines the answers to these questions

### Rationing System
**rationing** - method used to divide something amongst interested users

free market economy - **price rationing** is used to determine resource allocation and output/income distribution  
who receives what and how much they receive is based on the prices of goods and services  

planned economy - uses non-price rationing  
results from no markets or government intervention  
what/how much is produced, how it is produced, who will receive the output are determined by methods not related to prices in the market  

**In a free market economy, househoulds and firms control the resource and product markets**  
**A planned economy is marked by absence or limited operation of markets, the government makes all decisions on allocations and distribution of resources, goods, and services through methods that are not price rationing**  

## Mixed Economy and the Mixed Market Economy
public and private sector work together  
government normally makes decisions on activities under its ownership (parks, defense, etc.)  

however, government is not limited to just activities in its ownership  
United States government affects private sector via minimum wage, tax collection, anti-monopolative legislations, etc.  

government involvement is a response to the failure of the market mechanisms or to the demands or politically-powerful groups  
however, the extent to which the government is invovlved varies from country to country  

price rationing typically dominates over non-price rationing in mixed market economies  
in the absence of markets (public health care, defense systems, roads), non-price rationing occurs  
government acts as a central planner  
resources are distributed via non-price rationing (e.g. a queue for free healthcare)  

today, market-based activities have a higher popularity than central planning (less public sector involvement)  
supply-side policies and recognition of the limitations of central planning caused this shift in the 1980's
