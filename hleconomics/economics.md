# Sept. 4, 2024 - Intro to Economics  
  
Economics is a social science, i.e., it uses the scientific method to learn more about human interaction and society  
  
## Scarcity  
Economics is the study of choices on scarce resources, as human wants are infinite, but available resources are finite  
  
## Factors of Production  
- Land (gifts of nature)  
- Labour  
- Capital (manmade resources to boost production)  
- Entrepreneurship (innovate by developing new ways of doing things; takes on risk of success or failure of a business)  
  
## Other meanings of 'capital'  
- Physical (one of the factors of production)  
- Human (skills acquired by people -> more productivity)  
- Natural (expnds the factor of production 'land', necessary for human survival and opportunity)  
- Financial (investments and purchases of financial instruments, i.e. stocks and bonds)  
  
## Opportunity Cost  
exists as resources, like time and money, are scarce    
the value of the best altnerative that was given up to obtain something else    
  
## Free and Economic Goods  
free good - a good that is not scarce, and thus has an opportunity cost of 0    
  
economic good - a good that is scarce, either because it itself is a naturally scarce resource, or because it is produced by scarce resources    
as a result, all economic goods have an opportunity cost greater than 0    
  
a free good for one may be an economic good for another (clean air, airable soil)    
  
## Free good vs a good free of charge  
natural resources (known as a common pool resource) are free of a charge, but are an economic resource because they are scarce,  
and are becoming more scarce due to overuse and depletion    
  
services provided by the government are seemingly "free", but are produced by scarce resources, funded by tax revenues  
  
# Sept. 5, 2024 - What is Economics?

how to supply our wants with our limited resources?  
how do we allocate our resources efficiently and sustainably?  

main questions:
- what items, products, goods, or services to produce over others?
- how should we produce these items?
- for whom do we produce these items, and how much of said item do we give them?

Canada has a mixed market economy (partly controlled by the government and sellers)

characteristics:
- has a market and prices
- government influence
- control of what to put into the market

goals:
- income is distributed
- employ all available resources
- everyone is mostly employed 

## 9 key concepts:
- scarcity (how can resources be best used to satisfy wants and needs)
- choice (we need to choose what to produce, and what products are more important)
- efficiency (do not waste our limited resources, and fully employ our resources)
- equity (equally distributing income, wealth, and opportunity)
- economic well-being (health of economy enjoyed by the people)
- sustainability (using our resources wisely to not harm the opportunities of the future generations)
- change (understanding that the economic world is very fluid and is constantly in motion, our method of thinking must change on the situtation)
- interdependence (we are not self sufficient, and must rely on one another)
- intervention (government involvement in the working market)

## Scarcity and Choice
smart choices are needed to choose what to prioritize over the other, due to the limited nature of resources  

scaricty arises from limited money, time, and energy  
economics is the study of the choices leading to the best use of scarce resources to fulfill unlimited human wants and needs  

for society, all economic resources are scarce  
these resources come from human soceity and nature  

economic development is often achieved at the expense of the environment and natural resources  
overuse of these practices lead is unsustainable  

sustainability - using resources to produce goods whilst not making the resources any more scarce  

## Factors of Production  
- Land 
- Labour 
- Capital  
- Entrepreneurship  

Land - 'gifts of nature' used to produce goods  
resources may not be renewable, or take a long time to renew (sustainability)

labour - the work, time, and effort put into creating goods or services  
quality of labour (human capital) - the knowledge needed to provide a service or create a good  

capital - any machines, tools, instruments, or buildings used to create good and services  
we humans can not create everything by ourselves  

entrepreneurship - the human resources that organizes land, labour, and capital to produce goods and services  

these factors cause our resources, goods, and services to be scarce  

## 3 Economic Questions
- what
- how
- for whom 

### What do we produce first?  
how do we make said produce or provide a service? (do we need machines, human labour, money, or labour?)  

Resources Allocation - allocating resources properly to provide a good or service  
a change in the quantity of goods produced will involve a reallocation of resources (resources are limited)  

when a society produces too much of a good or service that is an overallocation of resources  

### What to produce?
objects that people value and products that satifies wants  
reallocation of resources will be needed (less farmers in Canada over the past 60 years)

what resources do we need to produce this product?  

### For whom to proudce?  
an economic goal is distributing goods equally (does not always happen)
how will goods and services be distributed to the population?

## Opportunity Cost and Production
the expected value of the best altnerative  
all human choices require cost and tradeoff  
every good a nation produces faces a tradeoff of a good it can no longer produce  
how much of each product is a nation willing to produce to maximize its resources (guns and butter)  

## Making Economic Choices 
market vs command method  
- market (private companies making decisions)
- command (government makes the choices and not the businesses)

## Resource Allocation and Output/Input Distribution 
3 main questions are forced by scarcity:
- what/how much to produce 
- how to produce (machine to labour ratio, which technologies, which materials, what skills)
- produce for whom? (equality vs earned, should certain services/goods be distributed more evenly)

**What/How to produce -> resource Allocation**  
**Whom to produce -> distribution of output and income**  

## Resource Allocation 
assigning available resources or factors of production to specific uses amongst altneratives  
what is produced, and how much is produced  
if a change in the number of goods produced is made a reallocation is required (overallocation vs underallocation)  

## Distribution of Output
how much of the produced goods do certain individuals or groups receive  
related to **distribution of income**  
amount people can buy is directly related to how much income they have  
**Redistribution of income** - when social groups receive more, less, or input/output less than previously

## Free Market Economy, Planned Economy, Mixed Economy 
real world economies normally mix free market and planned economies (mixed economies)  

### Resource ownership: public vs private sector
public sector - government owned and controlled  
private sector - owned by individuals, businesses, non-government organizations  

free market economy - private sector resource ownership  
planned economy - public sector resource ownership  

### Economic decision-making  
what and how much is produced, for whom is something produced?  

free market - private sector determines the answers to these questions  
planned economy - government determines the answers to these questions

### Rationing System
**rationing** - method used to divide something amongst interested users

free market economy - **price rationing** is used to determine resource allocation and output/income distribution  
who receives what and how much they receive is based on the prices of goods and services  

planned economy - uses non-price rationing  
results from no markets or government intervention  
what/how much is produced, how it is produced, who will receive the output are determined by methods not related to prices in the market  

**In a free market economy, househoulds and firms control the resource and product markets**  
**A planned economy is marked by absence or limited operation of markets, the government makes all decisions on allocations and distribution of resources, goods, and services through methods that are not price rationing**  

## Mixed Economy and the Mixed Market Economy
public and private sector work together  
government normally makes decisions on activities under its ownership (parks, defense, etc.)  

however, government is not limited to just activities in its ownership  
United States government affects private sector via minimum wage, tax collection, anti-monopolative legislations, etc.  

government involvement is a response to the failure of the market mechanisms or to the demands or politically-powerful groups  
however, the extent to which the government is invovlved varies from country to country  

price rationing typically dominates over non-price rationing in mixed market economies  
in the absence of markets (public health care, defense systems, roads), non-price rationing occurs  
government acts as a central planner  
resources are distributed via non-price rationing (e.g. a queue for free healthcare)  

today, market-based activities have a higher popularity than central planning (less public sector involvement)  
supply-side policies and recognition of the limitations of central planning caused this shift in the 1980's

## Positive and Normative Statements 
Positive - a prediction or statement based on fact and observable factors  
Normative - an opinion or belief; can not be corroborated or disproved  

# Sept. 11, 2024

## Production Possibilities Model
**production possibilities frontier (ppf)** - boundary between goods and services that can be produced and those can not  
comparing two items together  

production efficiency - we cannot produce more of one good without producing less of some other good  
points on the frontier are inefficient  

areas under the frontier means we are wasting resources  
anything in the shaded area is attainable, but resources are not being used efficiently  
the resources are either unemployed or unallocated  

**tradeoff along the PPF**  
every choice along the PPF involved a tradeoff  
resources are redistributed when one item is produced less to produce more of another item  

## Opportunity Cost 
PPF makes the concept of opportunity cost more tangible  
opportunity cost of the increase in *x* is the absence / cost of not producing *y* [view an example here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MF3c82nT7CPF4KYsdnMZpAyBjjEtVOImBhxeu7bYm_g/edit#slide=id.g151038b80da_0_722)

Ex: if more pizzas are produced, less CDs must be produced; the opportunity cost of producing *x* pizzas is *y* CDs  

the PPF bows outward, it is concave (not all resources can be used as efficiently as other resources)  

to grow the PPF, we must have some form of economic growth (more labour, technological development, more raw materials, more capital (machinery))  
the curve thus would then expand, more of each product could now be produced  

# Sept. 12, 2024 - Demand

## The Market
any place where buys and sellers of good and services meet together to make an exchange  

competitive markets - many different buyers and sellers  
there is not one individual seller monopolizing the market  

## Demand
**demand** - relationship between price of a good or serivce and the quantity that consumers are willing and able to buy at each price level  
demand is the whole price spectrum of a good or service  

**quantity demanded** - the specific amount of a good consumers will purchase at a specific price  

**demand schedule** - a table containing the price and quantity demanded at various prices  
can be turned into a demand graph  
price is the y-axis, and the quantity demanded is the x-axis  

demand curve is almost always downwards sloping  

**law of demand** - when the price of something goes down, people buy more of it; the inverse is true  
there is an inverse relationship between price of a good and quantity demanded  

why?  
holds because of *utility*  
**utility** - the benefit or satisfaction a consumer gets from consuming a good or service  

at a high price, consumer may perceive that the cost outweighs the benefit (utility) they recieve from the good  
thus, the consumer will be less willing to purchase it, leading to a lower quantity demanded  

at a low price, the consumer percieves the product as less of a service, and makes the good more attractive to buy  

as a good is purchased more, the satisfaction is less  

## Market vs Individual Demand  
**individual demand** - demand of a product for a single consumer at various prices  
**market demand** - sum of all the individual demands for a good at all price ranges  
(demand of a single city, nation, etc.)  

**demand is not static** (it is like a snapshot in time)  

## Changes in Demand
when something other than the price of a good changes, it affects how much the demand changes  
a change in demand will cause a new demand curve  

a demand curve shifting to the left means a higher demand; to the right signifies a lower demand

price itself does not change the demand, it only changes the **quantity demanded**
it moves you *along* the demand curve  

Factors that can cause a demand curve to shift (not price, as it moves your position on the curve):  
- number of buyers
- income  
- consumer preferences  
- consumer expectations (how people anticipate future prices and income impacts; e.g. anticipating a sale)  
- price of other products (substitutes and complements; e.g. ketchup and hotdogs)

# Sept. 13, 2024

## Supply Curve
the producers of good and services, and how price affects the quantities they produce  

**supply** - explains the behavious of producers and sellers  
supply is the relationship between the quantity of a good that producersare willing and able to provide

resources and technoogy determine what is possible  
supply reflects a decision about which technologically feasible items to produce  

quantity supplied - amount of goods a producer will make at a given price  
supply - the relationship between price and quantity  

some producers are more efficient, and thus produce their products at a lower **marginal cost** (the cost of making one unit of a product)  
firms with lower costs are willing to sell their products at a lower price  

firms will price the items to the highest price that bring in the most money  

**the law of supply** - there is a direct relationship between the price of a product and the quantity supplied  
if the price of a good increases, firms will increase the quantity supplied (for more profit)  
if the price of a good falls, firms will decrease the quantity supplied (note that demand has an *inverse* relationship)  

producers are willing to supply a good only if they at least cover their marginal cost of production  

**supply schedule** - a table representing how much producers are willing to sell at each price and quantity  

a supply schedule turns into the supply curve (a graph)  

### Vertical Supply Curve
**fixed quantity** - the price increases but there is no time or no possibility of ever producing more (antiques, original paintings, etc.)  

### Supply is not Static 
the supply curve does not represent a permanent relationship between price and production quantities (it is a snapshot in time)  

### Change in quantity supplied  
if price rises/falls, the quantity **supplied** is changed, not the supply  
other variables will change the *entire* supply curve either left (decrease) or right (increase)  

non-price determinants of supply:
- resource prices (raw materials)
- taxes (indirect / tax on profit; taxes are a cost of production)
- subsidies (payments to businesses from the government has the opposite effect of tax)  
- future expectations
- number of firms (as number of factories increase, so does the supply)  
- shocks (unpredictable events; e.g. natural disasters destroying raw materials / factories)
- technology (improving technology makes production more efficient; less waste or production at a cheaper price)  
- price of related goods and services (same productive resources; e.g. planting more wheat in a field than corn if corn is more expensive)  
(butter and skimmed milk are produced with the same resources, a producer will produce the cheaper one more)

## Substitution and Income effect 
related to demand, and can be used to explain the inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded  

**substitute effect** - when the price of an item decreases, a consumer is more likely to substitute (buy more) of a product  
**income effect** - when a consumer's purchasing power increases, such as when the price of an item falls (the consumer can now
buy more of the same item with the same amount of money), the consumer is more likely to buy more of said product

the inverse is true for both of these effects  
this can be used alongside the **law of diminishing marginal utility**  

# Sept. 19, 2024

moral vs natural philosophy  
moral - events and phenomena in the social world (economics)   
natural - events and phenomena in the natural world  

Adam Smith was the first to try to explain the economy in a systematic way  

## Adam Smith - Father of Economics 
wrote The Wealth of Nations  
mostly borrowed ideas of his time  
tried to explain how an economy can hold itself together and grow  

wanted to explain how an economic system without government control could prosper (was in a time where repressive government were under attack)  
if everyone does the best for oneself -> greatest good for society  

leads to competition  
keeps people's self-interest in check  

the **invisible hand**  
decisions that lead to the self-regulation of the market due to self-interest  

also known as the **laissez faire** economy (free market without government intervention)  

Adam Smith acknowledged the government should provide national defence, security and justice, and public infrastructure  
all this is financed through taxation  

believed competeition would cause monopolies to not arise  

allowed for *specialization* and *absolute advanage*  
absolute advantage - a country should produce that which it can produce the most efficiently  
if all countries traded amongst each other, and used absolute advantage, all would benefit  

## Classical Economics  
concerned with growth of the economy and distribution of income  

**Jeremy Bentham** promoted **utilitarianism**, a philosophy of ethics  
an action is right if it promotes the most happniess for the largest number of people  

**John Stuart Mill** furthered the idea of utilitarianism; the most important factor is happiness  

concerned with what gave products its *value*  
original **labour theory of value** - value comes from the amount of labour put in to cerate the product

two main factors:  
- utility, the pleausre from consuming something  
- the cost of consuming one more unit of the good (**marignal utility**)  

## Say's Law 
in ordinary circumstances, unemployment would not arise for long periods of time as the economy would keep
producing as much as is required to keep workers fully employed  

that being - **supply creates its own demand**  
a firm creating products provides workers enough money to buy products  

when the Great Depression came, general economics split into micro and macroeconomics to explain unemployment (economics was whole at this point)  

## Karl Marx 
based off the *labour theory of value*  
noticed **surplus value**  
surplus value - the excess profit firm owners make based off the price the product was sold and the wages the owners paid to get said product  

believed capitalism was unstable  
firm owners want to maximize profit, and would keep trying to find machines to automate the production process  
would lead to unemployment and poor working conditions  

his insights are still useful today (recurrence of crises, growing job insecurities, unemployment due to rapid techonlogical change)  
had influence on social sciences (sociology, anthropology, political science, etc.)  

## John Maynard Keynes
wages were sticky (meaning difficult to fall), and thus so were prices  
if wages fell, workers would have less to spend  
spending would go down, but prices would not as wages were sticky  
thus, the economic system could not on its own go back to full employment  

argued government would have to intervene by increasing government spending  
building more schools, roads, etc. would help unemployment (concept of a ***multiplier***)  

argued government intervention is needed to avoid prolonged recessions and high unemployment  

lead to the development of macroeconomics  

## Monetarism and New Classical Economics 
Milton Friedman emphasized the role of money in the economy  
change in the money supply affects output in the short-term, and prices levels in the long-term  

Robert Lucas emphasized the importance of individuals and their 'rational expectations' of inflation and government policy (new classical economics)  

these two different principles share a unifying principle - *the role of markets in bringing the economy back to a situation where
there is full employment without any government intervention*  

argued government intervention *causes* sticky prices and wages due to trade unions, minimum wage laws, etc.  
supply and demand would fix the markets on their own and achieve high levels of output and full employment  

rejects Keynesian economics and returns back to laissez-faire, giving the term *new classical*  

## Behavioural Economics 
argues the humand mind works in ways that are not rational  
experiments and evidence are used to create an economic theory, not a theory being created first, then it being used to explain human behaviour
this is then used to create economic policies  

**circular economy** - rather than creating products then throwing them out, we repurpose or repair those items to achieve sustainable development  

## Non-Price Determinants of Demand 
- income in case of normal goods -> if income increases, demand increases 
- income in case of inferior goods -> if income increases, demand decreases 
- preferences -> if preference for an item increases, demand increases 
- substitude goods (coca cola and pepsi) -> if price of good X decreases, demand for good Y decreases 
- complementary goods (computers and computer software) -> if price of good X decreases, demand for Y increases 
- number of consumers -> if consumers of a good increase, the demand for said good increases  

## Non-Price Determinants of Supply 
- cost of factors of production -> if a factor of production (labour, land, capital, etc.) increases in price, supply decreases
- technology -> as technology improves, supply increases as production is more efficient  
- competitive supply (corn and wheat) -> as the price of X decreases, the supply of Y increases (as Y is now more profitable relative to X), 
and vice versa
- joint supply (butter and skimmed milk) -> one can not be produced without the other, as price increases for X, supply for Y increases  
(removing cream from milk to turn into butter makes skimmed milk as a result)
- firm price expectations -> if a firm expects prices to rise, supply decreases 
- taxes -> as taxes increase (a cost of production), supply decreases 
- subsidies -> as subsidies increase, supply increases 
- number of firms -> as number of firms increase (number of producers), supply increases 
- shocks (war, weather, etc.) -> most probably a decrease in supply
