# Sept. 4, 2024 - Intro to Economics  
  
Economics is a social science, i.e., it uses the scientific method to learn more about human interaction and society  
  
## Scarcity  
Economics is the study of choices on scarce resources, as human wants are infinite, but available resources are finite  
  
## Factors of Production  
- Land (gifts of nature)  
- Labour  
- Capital (manmade resources to boost production)  
- Entrepreneurship (innovate by developing new ways of doing things; takes on risk of success or failure of a business)  
  
## Other meanings of 'capital'  
- Physical (one of the factors of production)  
- Human (skills acquired by people -> more productivity)  
- Natural (expnds the factor of production 'land', necessary for human survival and opportunity)  
- Financial (investments and purchases of financial instruments, i.e. stocks and bonds)  
  
## Opportunity Cost  
exists as resources, like time and money, are scarce    
the value of the best altnerative that was given up to obtain something else    
  
## Free and Economic Goods  
free good - a good that is not scarce, and thus has an opportunity cost of 0    
  
economic good - a good that is scarce, either because it itself is a naturally scarce resource, or because it is produced by scarce resources    
as a result, all economic goods have an opportunity cost greater than 0    
  
a free good for one may be an economic good for another (clean air, airable soil)    
  
## Free good vs a good free of charge  
natural resources (known as a common pool resource) are free of a charge, but are an economic resource because they are scarce,  
and are becoming more scarce due to overuse and depletion    
  
services provided by the government are seemingly "free", but are produced by scarce resources, funded by tax revenues  
  
# Sept. 5, 2024 - What is Economics?

how to supply our wants with our limited resources?  
how do we allocate our resources efficiently and sustainably?  

main questions:
- what items, products, goods, or services to produce over others?
- how should we produce these items?
- for whom do we produce these items, and how much of said item do we give them?

Canada has a mixed market economy (partly controlled by the government and sellers)

characteristics:
- has a market and prices
- government influence
- control of what to put into the market

goals:
- income is distributed
- employ all available resources
- everyone is mostly employed 

## 9 key concepts:
- scarcity (how can resources be best used to satisfy wants and needs)
- choice (we need to choose what to produce, and what products are more important)
- efficiency (do not waste our limited resources, and fully employ our resources)
- equity (equally distributing income, wealth, and opportunity)
- economic well-being (health of economy enjoyed by the people)
- sustainability (using our resources wisely to not harm the opportunities of the future generations)
- change (understanding that the economic world is very fluid and is constantly in motion, our method of thinking must change on the situtation)
- interdependence (we are not self sufficient, and must rely on one another)
- intervention (government involvement in the working market)

## Scarcity and Choice
smart choices are needed to choose what to prioritize over the other, due to the limited nature of resources  

scaricty arises from limited money, time, and energy  
economics is the study of the choices leading to the best use of scarce resources to fulfill unlimited human wants and needs  

for society, all economic resources are scarce  
these resources come from human society and nature  

economic development is often achieved at the expense of the environment and natural resources  
overuse of these practices lead is unsustainable  

sustainability - using resources to produce goods whilst not making the resources any more scarce  

## Factors of Production  
- Land 
- Labour 
- Capital  
- Entrepreneurship  

Land - 'gifts of nature' used to produce goods  
resources may not be renewable, or take a long time to renew (sustainability)

labour - the work, time, and effort put into creating goods or services  
quality of labour (human capital) - the knowledge needed to provide a service or create a good  

capital - any machines, tools, instruments, or buildings used to create good and services  
we humans can not create everything by ourselves  

entrepreneurship - the human resources that organizes land, labour, and capital to produce goods and services  

these factors cause our resources, goods, and services to be scarce  

## 3 Economic Questions
- what
- how
- for whom 

### What do we produce first?  
how do we make said produce or provide a service? (do we need machines, human labour, money, or labour?)  

Resources Allocation - allocating resources properly to provide a good or service  
a change in the quantity of goods produced will involve a reallocation of resources (resources are limited)  

when a society produces too much of a good or service that is an overallocation of resources  

### What to produce?
objects that people value and products that satifies wants  
reallocation of resources will be needed (less farmers in Canada over the past 60 years)

what resources do we need to produce this product?  

### For whom to proudce?  
an economic goal is distributing goods equally (does not always happen)
how will goods and services be distributed to the population?  

# Sept. 9, 2024

## Opportunity Cost and Production
the expected value of the best altnerative  
all human choices require cost and tradeoff  
every good a nation produces faces a tradeoff of a good it can no longer produce  
how much of each product is a nation willing to produce to maximize its resources (guns and butter)  

## Making Economic Choices 
market vs command method  
- market (private companies making decisions)
- command (government makes the choices and not the businesses)

## Resource Allocation and Output/Input Distribution 
3 main questions are forced by scarcity:
- what/how much to produce 
- how to produce (machine to labour ratio, which technologies, which materials, what skills)
- produce for whom? (equality vs earned, should certain services/goods be distributed more evenly)

**What/How to produce -> resource Allocation**  
**Whom to produce -> distribution of output and income**  

## Resource Allocation 
assigning available resources or factors of production to specific uses amongst altneratives  
what is produced, and how much is produced  
if a change in the number of goods produced is made a reallocation is required (overallocation vs underallocation)  

## Distribution of Output
how much of the produced goods do certain individuals or groups receive  
related to **distribution of income**  
amount people can buy is directly related to how much income they have  
**Redistribution of income** - when social groups receive more, less, or input/output less than previously

## Free Market Economy, Planned Economy, Mixed Economy 
real world economies normally mix free market and planned economies (mixed economies)  

### Resource ownership: public vs private sector
public sector - government owned and controlled  
private sector - owned by individuals, businesses, non-government organizations  

free market economy - private sector resource ownership  
planned economy - public sector resource ownership  

### Economic decision-making  
what and how much is produced, for whom is something produced?  

free market - private sector determines the answers to these questions  
planned economy - government determines the answers to these questions

### Rationing System
**rationing** - method used to divide something amongst interested users

free market economy - **price rationing** is used to determine resource allocation and output/income distribution  
who receives what and how much they receive is based on the prices of goods and services  

planned economy - uses non-price rationing  
results from no markets or government intervention  
what/how much is produced, how it is produced, who will receive the output are determined by methods not related to prices in the market  

**In a free market economy, househoulds and firms control the resource and product markets**  
**A planned economy is marked by absence or limited operation of markets, the government makes all decisions on allocations and distribution of resources, goods, and services through methods that are not price rationing**  

## Mixed Economy and the Mixed Market Economy
public and private sector work together  
government normally makes decisions on activities under its ownership (parks, defense, etc.)  

however, government is not limited to just activities in its ownership  
United States government affects private sector via minimum wage, tax collection, anti-monopolative legislations, etc.  

government involvement is a response to the failure of the market mechanisms or to the demands or politically-powerful groups  
however, the extent to which the government is invovlved varies from country to country  

price rationing typically dominates over non-price rationing in mixed market economies  
in the absence of markets (public health care, defense systems, roads), non-price rationing occurs  
government acts as a central planner  
resources are distributed via non-price rationing (e.g. a queue for free healthcare)  

today, market-based activities have a higher popularity than central planning (less public sector involvement)  
supply-side policies and recognition of the limitations of central planning caused this shift in the 1980's

## Positive and Normative Statements 
Positive - a prediction or statement based on fact and observable factors  
Normative - an opinion or belief; can not be corroborated or disproved  

# Sept. 11, 2024

## Production Possibilities Model
**production possibilities frontier (ppf)** - boundary between goods and services that can be produced and those can not  
comparing two items together  

production efficiency - we cannot produce more of one good without producing less of some other good  
points on the frontier are inefficient  

areas under the frontier means we are wasting resources  
anything in the shaded area is attainable, but resources are not being used efficiently  
the resources are either unemployed or unallocated  

**tradeoff along the PPF**  
every choice along the PPF involved a tradeoff  
resources are redistributed when one item is produced less to produce more of another item  

## Opportunity Cost 
PPF makes the concept of opportunity cost more tangible  
opportunity cost of the increase in *x* is the absence / cost of not producing *y* [view an example here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MF3c82nT7CPF4KYsdnMZpAyBjjEtVOImBhxeu7bYm_g/edit#slide=id.g151038b80da_0_722)

Ex: if more pizzas are produced, less CDs must be produced; the opportunity cost of producing *x* pizzas is *y* CDs  

the PPF bows outward, it is concave (not all resources can be used as efficiently as other resources)  

to grow the PPF, we must have some form of economic growth (more labour, technological development, more raw materials, more capital (machinery))  
the curve thus would then expand, more of each product could now be produced  

# Sept. 12, 2024 - Demand

## The Market
any place where buys and sellers of good and services meet together to make an exchange  

competitive markets - many different buyers and sellers  
there is not one individual seller monopolizing the market  

## Demand
**demand** - relationship between price of a good or serivce and the quantity that consumers are willing and able to buy at each price level  
demand is the whole price spectrum of a good or service  

**quantity demanded** - the specific amount of a good consumers will purchase at a specific price  

**demand schedule** - a table containing the price and quantity demanded at various prices  
can be turned into a demand graph  
price is the y-axis, and the quantity demanded is the x-axis  

demand curve is almost always downwards sloping  

**law of demand** - when the price of something goes down, people buy more of it; the inverse is true  
there is an inverse relationship between price of a good and quantity demanded  

why?  
holds because of *utility*  
**utility** - the benefit or satisfaction a consumer gets from consuming a good or service  

at a high price, consumer may perceive that the cost outweighs the benefit (utility) they recieve from the good  
thus, the consumer will be less willing to purchase it, leading to a lower quantity demanded  

at a low price, the consumer percieves the product as less of a service, and makes the good more attractive to buy  

as a good is purchased more, the satisfaction is less  

## Market vs Individual Demand  
**individual demand** - demand of a product for a single consumer at various prices  
**market demand** - sum of all the individual demands for a good at all price ranges  
(demand of a single city, nation, etc.)  

**demand is not static** (it is like a snapshot in time)  

## Changes in Demand
when something other than the price of a good changes, it affects how much the demand changes  
a change in demand will cause a new demand curve  

a demand curve shifting to the left means a higher demand; to the right signifies a lower demand

price itself does not change the demand, it only changes the **quantity demanded**
it moves you *along* the demand curve  

Factors that can cause a demand curve to shift (not price, as it moves your position on the curve):  
- number of buyers
- income  
- consumer preferences  
- consumer expectations (how people anticipate future prices and income impacts; e.g. anticipating a sale)  
- price of other products (substitutes and complements; e.g. ketchup and hotdogs)

# Sept. 13, 2024

## Supply Curve
the producers of good and services, and how price affects the quantities they produce  

**supply** - explains the behavious of producers and sellers  
supply is the relationship between the quantity of a good that producersare willing and able to provide

resources and technoogy determine what is possible  
supply reflects a decision about which technologically feasible items to produce  

quantity supplied - amount of goods a producer will make at a given price  
supply - the relationship between price and quantity  

some producers are more efficient, and thus produce their products at a lower **marginal cost** (the cost of making one unit of a product)  
firms with lower costs are willing to sell their products at a lower price  

firms will price the items to the highest price that bring in the most money  

**the law of supply** - there is a direct relationship between the price of a product and the quantity supplied  
if the price of a good increases, firms will increase the quantity supplied (for more profit)  
if the price of a good falls, firms will decrease the quantity supplied (note that demand has an *inverse* relationship)  

producers are willing to supply a good only if they at least cover their marginal cost of production  

**supply schedule** - a table representing how much producers are willing to sell at each price and quantity  

a supply schedule turns into the supply curve (a graph)  

### Vertical Supply Curve
**fixed quantity** - the price increases but there is no time or no possibility of ever producing more (antiques, original paintings, etc.)  

### Supply is not Static 
the supply curve does not represent a permanent relationship between price and production quantities (it is a snapshot in time)  

### Change in quantity supplied  
if price rises/falls, the quantity **supplied** is changed, not the supply  
other variables will change the *entire* supply curve either left (decrease) or right (increase)  

non-price determinants of supply:
- resource prices (raw materials)
- taxes (indirect / tax on profit; taxes are a cost of production)
- subsidies (payments to businesses from the government has the opposite effect of tax)  
- future expectations
- number of firms (as number of factories increase, so does the supply)  
- shocks (unpredictable events; e.g. natural disasters destroying raw materials / factories)
- technology (improving technology makes production more efficient; less waste or production at a cheaper price)  
- price of related goods and services (same productive resources; e.g. planting more wheat in a field than corn if corn is more expensive)  
(butter and skimmed milk are produced with the same resources, a producer will produce the cheaper one more)  

# Sept. 17, 2024

## Substitution and Income effect 
related to demand, and can be used to explain the inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded  

**substitute effect** - when the price of an item decreases, a consumer is more likely to substitute (buy more) of a product  
**income effect** - when a consumer's purchasing power increases, such as when the price of an item falls (the consumer can now
buy more of the same item with the same amount of money), the consumer is more likely to buy more of said product

the inverse is true for both of these effects  
this can be used alongside the **law of diminishing marginal utility**  

# Sept. 19, 2024

moral vs natural philosophy  
moral - events and phenomena in the social world (economics)   
natural - events and phenomena in the natural world  

Adam Smith was the first to try to explain the economy in a systematic way  

## Adam Smith - Father of Economics 
wrote The Wealth of Nations  
mostly borrowed ideas of his time  
tried to explain how an economy can hold itself together and grow  

wanted to explain how an economic system without government control could prosper (was in a time where repressive government were under attack)  
if everyone does the best for oneself -> greatest good for society  

leads to competition  
keeps people's self-interest in check  

the **invisible hand**  
decisions that lead to the self-regulation of the market due to self-interest  

also known as the **laissez faire** economy (free market without government intervention)  

Adam Smith acknowledged the government should provide national defence, security and justice, and public infrastructure  
all this is financed through taxation  

believed competeition would cause monopolies to not arise  

allowed for *specialization* and *absolute advanage*  
absolute advantage - a country should produce that which it can produce the most efficiently  
if all countries traded amongst each other, and used absolute advantage, all would benefit  

## Classical Economics  
concerned with growth of the economy and distribution of income  

**Jeremy Bentham** promoted **utilitarianism**, a philosophy of ethics  
an action is right if it promotes the most happniess for the largest number of people  

**John Stuart Mill** furthered the idea of utilitarianism; the most important factor is happiness  

concerned with what gave products its *value*  
original **labour theory of value** - value comes from the amount of labour put in to cerate the product

two main factors:  
- utility, the pleausre from consuming something  
- the cost of consuming one more unit of the good (**marignal utility**)  

## Say's Law 
in ordinary circumstances, unemployment would not arise for long periods of time as the economy would keep
producing as much as is required to keep workers fully employed  

that being - **supply creates its own demand**  
a firm creating products provides workers enough money to buy products  

when the Great Depression came, general economics split into micro and macroeconomics to explain unemployment (economics was whole at this point)  

## Karl Marx 
based off the *labour theory of value*  
noticed **surplus value**  
surplus value - the excess profit firm owners make based off the price the product was sold and the wages the owners paid to get said product  

believed capitalism was unstable  
firm owners want to maximize profit, and would keep trying to find machines to automate the production process  
would lead to unemployment and poor working conditions  

his insights are still useful today (recurrence of crises, growing job insecurities, unemployment due to rapid techonlogical change)  
had influence on social sciences (sociology, anthropology, political science, etc.)  

## John Maynard Keynes
wages were sticky (meaning difficult to fall), and thus so were prices  
if wages fell, workers would have less to spend  
spending would go down, but prices would not as wages were sticky  
thus, the economic system could not on its own go back to full employment  

argued government would have to intervene by increasing government spending  
building more schools, roads, etc. would help unemployment (concept of a ***multiplier***)  

argued government intervention is needed to avoid prolonged recessions and high unemployment  

lead to the development of macroeconomics  

## Monetarism and New Classical Economics 
Milton Friedman emphasized the role of money in the economy  
change in the money supply affects output in the short-term, and prices levels in the long-term  

Robert Lucas emphasized the importance of individuals and their 'rational expectations' of inflation and government policy (new classical economics)  

these two different principles share a unifying principle - *the role of markets in bringing the economy back to a situation where
there is full employment without any government intervention*  

argued government intervention *causes* sticky prices and wages due to trade unions, minimum wage laws, etc.  
supply and demand would fix the markets on their own and achieve high levels of output and full employment  

rejects Keynesian economics and returns back to laissez-faire, giving the term *new classical*  

## Behavioural Economics 
argues the humand mind works in ways that are not rational  
experiments and evidence are used to create an economic theory, not a theory being created first, then it being used to explain human behaviour
this is then used to create economic policies  

**circular economy** - rather than creating products then throwing them out, we repurpose or repair those items to achieve sustainable development  

## Non-Price Determinants of Demand 
- income in case of normal goods -> if income increases, demand increases 
- income in case of inferior goods -> if income increases, demand decreases 
- preferences -> if preference for an item increases, demand increases 
- substitude goods (coca cola and pepsi) -> if price of good X decreases, demand for good Y decreases 
- complementary goods (computers and computer software) -> if price of good X decreases, demand for Y increases 
- number of consumers -> if consumers of a good increase, the demand for said good increases  

## Non-Price Determinants of Supply 
- cost of factors of production -> if a factor of production (labour, land, capital, etc.) increases in price, supply decreases
- technology -> as technology improves, supply increases as production is more efficient  
- competitive supply (corn and wheat) -> as the price of X decreases, the supply of Y increases (as Y is now more profitable relative to X), 
and vice versa
- joint supply (butter and skimmed milk) -> one can not be produced without the other, as price increases for X, supply for Y increases  
(removing cream from milk to turn into butter makes skimmed milk as a result)
- firm price expectations -> if a firm expects prices to rise, supply decreases 
- taxes -> as taxes increase (a cost of production), supply decreases 
- subsidies -> as subsidies increase, supply increases 
- number of firms -> as number of firms increase (number of producers), supply increases 
- shocks (war, weather, etc.) -> most probably a decrease in supply

# Sept. 20, 2024 - Understand the world through the use of models  

## The Circular Flow Income Model
assume our economy is a closed economy (no international trade)  
income is flowing only around our economy  

demonstrates how income flows around the economy  
the only decision markets are households and firms  
linked through product and resources markets  

firms buy factors of production in the resource markets  
households make up the resource markets  
firms then produce goods, which goes into the product markets  
households then buy from the product markets, giving money back to the firms  

households sell their factors of production to firms, they receive payments (**income of households**) (wages, rent payments, etc.)  
payments that households make to buy goods and services are **household expenditures**   

payments that firms make to buy factors of production are **cost of production** and payments they receive is their **revenue**  

firms -> households -> firms  

## Leakages and Injections
in the real world, there is very few closed economies  
some factors that cause money to leak out of the economy and factors that inject money into the eocnomy  

**Leakages** - non-consumption uses of income that reduce the flow of money in the economy  
**Injections** - money that comes into the economy that stimulate economic activity  

an economy aims to have an equal amount of leaks and injections  
all leakages will eventually be injected back into the economy in some way  

Leakages occur due to:  
- savings -> households do not spend every single penny that they make, the households are not spending all the money that firms pay them  
- taxes -> money is not immediately given back to households  
- imports -> spending on foreign goods and services takes money out of the domestic economy, lowering domestic demand  

all these factors disrupt the circular flow income model  

Injections occur due to:  
- investments -> expenditures by firms on capital goods boost production and create jobs, money and more jobs are entering the economy  
- government spending -> spending on public infrastructure and services stimulates demands in the economy by making us more efficient in 
resource consumption  
- exports -> sales of domestically produced goods and services to foreign buyers brings money into the domestic economy  

## Three pairs of leakges and injections
pairs:
- financial markets
- governments 
- other countries 

### Financial Markets 
households save money they gain, leaking money from the economy  
firms invest in products / capital from their savings, injecting money into the economy  

### Governments
governments tax people and firms, leaking money from the economy  
governments start public projects to build infrastructure and to provide more goods, injecting money into the economy  

### Other Countries
households / firms buy goods from other countries, leaking money from the economy  
other countries purchase domestic goods, increasing demand and injecting money into the domestic economy  

# Sept. 23, 2024 

as price increases, suppliers will supply more  
price is an **incentive** for suppliers  

## Factors increasing supply 
- cost of production decreases  
- techonlogy improves  
- sellers expected good things in the future  
- more sellers enter the market  
- opportunities in different markets are bad  
- favourable natural events  

## Factors decreasing supply  
- cost of production increases  
- technology becomes outdated  
- sellers expect bad things in the future  
- sellers leave the market 
- opportunities in other markets are good  
- unfavourable natural events 

increase in supply -> price goes down   
decrease in supply -> price goes up  
*supply, not quantity supplied*  

## Theory of the Firm 
analyzes how businesses make decisions regarding production, pricing, and resource allocation to maximize profits  
assumes all businesses are trying to maximize profits  
*invisible hand* comes into play here  

**shows the relationship between revenue, costs, and profits**  

revenue depends on price charges and the quantity sold at that price  

costs depend on **fixed costs** and **variable costs**  
fixed costs - remain the same at all levels of production (rent)  
variable costs - change with the level of production (labour / wages, utility bills, etc.)  

**total profit / revenue = (price * quantity sold) - (variable + fixed costs)**

## Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns  
all firms use inputs (resources, factors of production) to produce outputs  

short run vs long run (time periods)  

**short run** - costs of resources and inputs are relatively flexible, and can be adjusted quickly  
maximum capacity is *fixed* because of a shortage of at least one resource (a **limiting factor**, normally a factor or production or a fixed cost)    
thus, the ability to produce is limited  

Ex: a factory can increase production by running machinery longer or adding shifts, but it cannot buy new machines immediately
due to fixed capital costs

factories are a fixed, capital resource that can not quickly be adjusted (it is a *fixed cost*)  

**long run** - all costs are variable (nothing is fixed)  
costs and resources can all be adjusted  
factors of production can be adjusted  

Ex: a manufacturing company may build a new facility to increase 
production capacity after analyzing long-term market trends.  

## Diminishing Returns 
firms have both fixed and variable inputs  
**marginal product** - refers to the additional output generated by adding one more unit of a specific input, while keeping other inputs constant  

- total product -> total quantity of output  
- marginal product -> extra or additional output produced by adding one additional variable (1 more labourer)  
- total cost -> all costs of production incurred by a firm  
- marginal cost -> the extra cost of producing one more unit of *output*  

## Law of Diminishing Returns / Law of Diminishing Marginal Products  
as more units of variable inputs (labour) are added to fixed inputs (land), the marginal product of the variable input will 
at first input, but eventually, there will be a point where the marginal product will begin to fall  

in case of workers, a possible explanation is that there simply is not enough work to do for the new unit of variable input (new labourer) to 
be put to 100% efficiency  

marginal product (MP) decreases as variable inputs increase so long as other inputs remain constant  

Ex: if there are 8 workers and 6 machines, any additional workers (increases in variable inputs) will have a marginal product (MP) of 0  

# Sept. 25, 2024 

## Market Equilibrium
the buyer must agree to buy at a price, and the seller to sell the product at the same price  
they must agree for the transaction to occur  

**market equilibrium** - when buyers and sellers agree to a price  

the *invisible hand* guides the market  
the market will eventually balance itself out, the buyers and sellers will come to an agreement in a competitive market  

equilibrium is a situation in which opposing forces balance each other.  
**equilibrium price** - quantity demanded == quantity supplied  
**equilibrium quantity** - the quantity bought and sold at the equilibrium price (where supply and demand intersect)  

## Surplus 
at higher prices, a surplus occurs  
suppliers will want to produce more than buyers will consume  

the suppliers want to profit at the higher price, and thus will produce more  
however, the consumer is not willing to purchase that product at that price (at least not at the quantity that is being supplied)  

## Shortage
at low prices, buyers are willing to buy more than suppliers are willing to supply  

suppliers do not want to produce / supply this product as they are making less of a profit  

## PPC
as wants and needs changes, the production point on the PPC moves  
the interaction between buyers and suppliers move where the society is on the PPC  

at equilibrium, the buyers and sellers' choices are satisfied and in balance  
this is the **market mechanism**, known as the *invisible hand*  

firms that produce product determine how they will produce products based off what resources and technologies are available to them  

## Price Signals and Incentives
as signals prices communicate info to the decision makers  
as incentives prices motivate decision makers to respond to the information  

is it possible for market equilibrium to not be achieved (be in surplus or shortage)?  
in the short term, *yes*, that is possible due to constant fluctuations  

surplus -> equilibrium, buyers will buy less  
shortage -> equilibrium, sellers will produce more  

## Surplus to Equilibrium
as surplus builds up, producers will be left with too much good that can not be sold - **surplus inventory**  
suppliers will then drive the price down to get rid of the product  

## Price Adjustments
prices below equilibrium -> a shortage forces the price to go up  
prices above the equilibrium -> a surplus forces prices to go down  

## Shortage to Equilibrium
prices are too low  
suppliers see a chance to make a profit, and raise the price of the product  
hope to deter some consumers from buying the product  
the supply can not currently meet the demand  

**supply and demand will often change due to a changing economic climate**  

as price goes up, the demand decrease, and producers will produce more -> equilibrium  

## Changes in Demand 
an increase in demand shifts the demand curve to the right  
this also shifts the equilibrium price  
looking at the original equilibrium, there is now a shortage (prices will go up to reach equilibrium)  

## Changes in Supply 
if supply shifts to the right, a surplus at the original price will occur  
prices will fall, and thus quantity demanded will increase  

## Double Shifts
when both curves shift, either the price or the quantity will be indeterminate

**signals** tells economic agents make decisions by conveying the current state of the market or economy  
**incentives** are something that motivates individuals or firms to behave in a particular way by altering the costs and benefits
associated with a choice  

**rationing** - a way of distributing or allocating goods and services among consumers or households  
pricing rationing - those that are willing and able to pay the price at that price will recieve the good / service  
non-price rationing - first come first serve  

**efficiency** - making the best use of resources  
**allocative efficiency** - producing the combination of goods most wanted by society  
**productive efficiency** - producing goods using the fewest possible resources, at the lowest cost  

**economic efficiency** - efficient producers must produce the right combination of resources for the economy  

## Consumer surplus
the highest price to pay for a good minus the price actually paid  
area between demand curve and equilibrium price  

## Producer surplus
the price received for selling their good inus the lowest price they are willing to accept to produce that good  
the lowest price a firm is willing to accept represents the cost of producing an extra unit of the good (marginal cost)  

## Competitive Market Equilibrium  
the sum of the consumer and producer surplus is known as a **social or community surplus**  
this value is maximized at market equilibrium  

market equilibrium is when marginal benefit (demand curve) = marginal cost (supply curve)  
social surplus is maximized  
allocative efficiency is achieved  
social welfare is also maximized (well-being of society)  

P intercept - the point on the P axis that is met by a curve  
Q intercept - the point on the Q axis that is met by a curve  

## Formulas
**consumer surplus** = ((P intercept of demand curve - equilibrium price) \* equilibrium quantity) / 2  
**producer surplus** = ((equilibrium price - P intercept of supply curve) \* equilibrium quantity) / 2  
social surplus = consumer surplus + producer surplus  

## Area of Trapezium
there may not always be a P intercept  

A = ((a + b) \* c) / 2 (area of trapezoid)  

## Government Intervention
**when looking at market efficiency, there should be no government intervention**  
efficiency is only possible in highly unrealistic conditions  
market failrues are an important justification for government intervention  

competitive markets can not sufficiently answer *whom* to produce for  

# Oct. 1, 2024

economic theories are based of the assumption of **rational economic decision-making**  
individuals aim to maximize ssatisfaction  

## Rational Consumer Choice
consumers make decisions according to their tastes  
3 assumptions:  
- consumer is able to rank goods according to preference (*completeness* assumption)  
- preferences among alternative choices are consistent (*transitivity* assumption)  
- consumer prefers more than less (*non-satiation* assumption)  

assumes consumers have **perfect information** (sees the full picture about altneratives)  
assumes consumers will try to maximize their *utility*  

## Behavioural Economics
criticizes consumer rationality and utility maximization  

### Biases
**bias (cognitive bias)** - systematic errors in thinking or evaluating  

types of biases:  

#### Rules of thumb
simplifies consumer choices rather than making complicated decisions  

1 cup of coffee has 80mg of caffeine, etc.  

#### Anchoring
using irrelevant information to make decisions, most often due to it being the first piece of information seen  

buying pants at $100 after seeing another pair at $150 thinking its a bargain, when a pair could have been bought at $50  

#### Framing
deals with how choices are presented to the consumer  

80% lean beef vs 20% fat beef  
faded jeans at a boutique store vs at a discount store  

#### Availability
people tend to rely on information that is more readily available, partly due to people remembering recents events and information 
more than past events and information  

after seeing advertisements on the superiority of brand 2, a consumer may be more likely to select brand 2 than brand 1  

biases lead to the belief there is a more accurate way to describe consumer behaviour:  

### Bounded Rationality
consumers are rational within limits, maximizing utility is a costly process  
rationality is limited by a consumer's information, the costliness to obtain information, and the ability to process large amounts of information  

consumers seek **satisfice** (seeking a satisfactory outcome over the optimal outcome)  

### Bounded Self-Control
people do not have the self-control to always make rational decisions

### Bounded Selfishness
people are only selfish within limits  
people do not always act in their best self-interest  

### Imperfect Information
consumers do not have access to complete information on prices, products, quality, etc.  
thus, it is impossible to maximize utility, as *perfect knowledge* was an initial assumption  

behavioural economics is not based on assumptions on human behaviour, rather experiments that try to observe how people behave and react  

### Nudge Theory
**nudge** - a method designed to influence consumers' choices in a predictable way, without offering
financial incentives or imposing sanctions, and without limiting choice  

Ex:  
in the United Kingdoms, tax payments of late taxpayers increased by 15% when told most people in their area had already paid their taxes  

behavioural economics has been more successful in finance  

### Choice Architecture
based on the idea that consumers are influcned by how options are presented to them  

**framing** is an important part of choice architecture  
framing defines the context in which choices are presented to decision-makers  

different types of choices:  

#### Default Choice
choice made when the consumers does not do anything  
made by habit or lack of interest in taking a deliberate action  

#### Restricted Choice
choice that is limited by the government or other authority  

Ex:  
speed limits, voting age, etc.  

argued that people have too many choices available, and not enough information to make good choices  
choice architecture can take advantage of restrictions to encourage people to make choices with socially desirable outcomes  

#### Mandated Choice
choice between altneratives that is compulsory by the government or authority (a required choice)  
it is a free choice, but is is mandatory to make that free choice  

nudges often affects consumers on a sub-conscious level; it is manipulative  

choice architecture takes advantage of the incomplete information available to the consumer, and 
selectively provides information (such as through framing) to encourage consumers to act in a particular way  
thus, it is argued that there should be transparency and open discussion of nudges used for economic policy  

### Evaluating Behaviour Economics
advantages:  
- simple and low-cost way to influence people's behaviour to act in socially desireable ways  
- has shown success, implying choice architecture and nudging have numerous possible applications in areas that are yet unexplored  
- offers consumers and citizens freedom of choice without restricting or forcing them to do anything  
- may overcome the theory of consumer behaviour, due to the irrationality of actual consumer behaviour  
- policies are based on psychology, which have been tested over many years  
- policies are developed through trials, allowing for trial-and-error methods to achieve desired results  

disadvantages:  
- it is not based on any understanding of human behaviour, and thus can not lead to a systematic and unifying theory on human
behaviour with general applicability
- the unsystematic approach may not be valid over time or across different income groups, social groups, or cultures -> reduces
applicability of policies being devloped over time and in different people groups
- using psychological principles to manipulate consumers to act in ways not necessarily in their best interests  
- behavioural policies may be used as substitutes to necessary but politically costly economic policies, such as taxes on
socially harmful goods
- traditional economic policies may be more effective
- could be a new form of government regulation camouflaged under the guise of freedom and choice -> more dangerous than conventional
government control as people may not be aware of its existence and its effects on their choices
- choice architecture and nudging may affect people's choices, but these choices may not be a reflection of their true preferences

## Firm Business Objectives
standard economic theory of the firm assumes **rational producer behaviour**  
firms want to maximize profit  

profit maximization involves determing the level of output to produce the maximum profit  

profit = revenue - cost  

profit maximization may not always be the overriding objective of firms  

self-interested behaviour of firms often leads to negative consequences for society  
Ex:  
underpaying child labour, polluting the environment, etc.  

however, these consequences can lead to a negative image by society, lowering profits, or lead to government regulation, also lowering profits  
thus, firms must display **corporate social responsibility**, such as:  
- avoiding polluting activities  
- supporting human rights, such as avoiding child labour and investing in countries with politically oppressive regimes  
- art and athletics sponsorships  
- donations to charities  

whilst ethical behaviour may lower costs and increase expected profits, unethical behaviour may lead to boycotts
and customer avoidance, lowering total profits  

studies that try to measure how behaviouru correlates to profits have been inconclusive, but majority of firms do not want to take this risk  

### Market Share 
percentage of total sales in a market that is earned by a single firm  
high market share indicates popularity amongst buyers  

implies a high **economies of scale**, allowing firms to increase its profitability  

market share is important as it allows comparisons of how well a firm is doing to its competitors  

maintaining market share -> growing at the same rate as overall market  
growing market share -> doing well in comparison to competitors  
falling market share -> not doing as well in competitors in terms of sales of its products  

firms may try to lower its prices, introduce new or innovative products into the market, or use advertising to increase market share  
each carry a risk of lowering profits  
lowered profits may be acceptable if the firm remains profitable and continues to earn a satisfactory level of profits  

### Growth Maximization
another possible objective instead of maximizing profits  

why?  
- growing firm can achieve economies of scale and lower its average costs  
- can diversify production of different products and markets and reduce its dependence on a single product or market  
- greater market power and increased ability fo influence prices, again potentially increasing its profitability  
- reduces its risks as it is less affect in a economic downturn (recession) and less likely to be taken over (bought) by another firm  
- reconciles interests of both owners and managers (profit maximization favours owners whereas revenue maximization favours managers)  

### Revenue Maximization
firm managers may be more interseted in maximizing revenue and sales rather than profit  
this is due to:  
- sales can be identified and measured more easily than profits in the short term, whcih can be used to motivate employees  
- rewards for managers and employees are often linked to increased sales rather than increased profits  
- it is often assumed revenue from more sales will increase more rapidly than cost, causing profit to also increase  
- increased sales give rise to feelings of success, whereas decreased sales create feelings of failure  

### Satisficing 
a firm will typically not only try to maximize one goal (profits, market share, etc.)  
rather, a firm is composed of separate groups, each with its own objectives that may overlap or conflict  

prevents a firm from pursuing any kind of maximizing behaviour  
firms thus establish processes where they can compromise, which results in the pursuit of many objectives that are placed in a hierarchy  
this behaviour is known as **satisficing**  

**satisficing** - firms try to achieve a satisfactory level of profits together with satisfactory results for many 
more objectives, rather than the optimal or 'best' results for any one objective  
Ex:  
a firm does not solely maximize profits but also growth and revenue as well  

# Oct. 2, 2024 - Elasticity

elasticity of demand and supply  

## Elasticity of Demand
**elastic** - how much something can stretch or change in response to another variable  

**Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)** - the measure of change in quantity demanded and the change in its price  
PED is calculated *along* the demand curve  

price inelastic - a change in price causes a smaller % change in demand  
price elastic - a change in price causes a bigger % change in demand  

### Elastic Goods
goods with very elastic demand tend to be non-necessary goods (designer shoes, luxury handbags, etc.)  

### Inelastic Goods
goods with **no easy substitutes** (insulin, gasoline, etc.)  
**when price increases, demand stays relatively steady**  
there are no other options, consumers need to buy the same amount  

an increase in price would ahve less of an effect on the consumption of staple foods than it would have on luxury foods (rice vs apple pie)  

### Why PED Matters
it is important to understand price elasticity to know how the relationship between the price of a good influence its demand  
if the quantity demanded changes a lot when prices changes a little, a product is said to be *elastic*  
when there is a small change in quantity demanded when prices changes a lot, a product is said to be *inelastic*  

PED = percentage change in quantity demanded / percentage change in price  

price elasticity is usually **negative**  
it is a common practice to use the **absolute value** instead  
done to avoid confusion when making comparisons between different values of PED  

the final value is the **coefficient of elasticity**  

results:  
- PED = 0 -> consumers pay no attention to price (insulin); represented by a **veritcal line**  
- 0 < PED < 1 -> inelastic price; consumers are not *too* sensitive to price (gasoline)  
- PED = 1 -> (**unit elastic**) demand is neither elastic nor inelastic; prices change by x%, quantity demanded changes by x%  
- PED > 1 -> elastic demand; consumers are *very* sensitive to changes in prcie (luxury items)  
- PED is infinite -> consumers will not buy the product if the price changes *slightly*; represented by a **horizontal line**  

elastic / inelastic should only be used to refer to a portion of a demand curve  
elasticity changes along the position of the demand curve  

### Determinants of PED
S: available substitutes -> more elastic  
P: proportion of income spent -> more elastic 
L: luxuries and necessities -> necessities are inelastic  
A: habit forming or addictive -> inelastic  
T: time to adjust / length of time -> over time, goods become more elastic, as it becomes easier to buy **other** goods (substitutes)  

can not be compared based on the slope of the curve, the calculations must be done due to different scales  
PED's can only be compared if they intersect at some point  

### Total Revenue
each section of the demand curve has a different PED  
**total revenue** - price \* quantity (at a certain point on the demand curve)  

inelastic - total revenue moved in same direction as the price  
elastic - total revenue moved in the opposite direction as price  
unit elastic - total revenue did not change  

**profit** = total revenue - total cost  
a firm aims to maximize *profit* not revenue  
as revenue rises, cost may rise faster  

## Primary Commodities vs Manufactured Products  
**primary commodities** - goods arising directly from the use of natural resources; normally inelastic (foods and oils)  
**manufactured products** - goods produced by labour usually working together with capital and raw materials; more elastic
as there are substitutes (computers and cars)  

# Oct. 3, 2024

## Income Elasticity of Demand (YED)  
measures how the quantity demanded of a good or service changes in response to a chnage in consumer income  
used to determine if a good is a normal or inferior good  

provides info of demand given a change in income and the size of the change  

**YED** = % change in quantity demanded / % change in income  

YED can be both positive and negative  
positive number -> normal good at that income level (income increases, demand increases)  
negative number -> inferior good at that income level  

types of positive YED:
- 0 < YED < 1 -> income inelastic demand (necessities)  
- YED > 1 -> normal goods that are **luxuries** (income elastic demand)  
- YED < 0 -> inferior good, demand and income are inversely proportional (ex: taking the bus, second-hand clothes, etc.)  

YED < 1 (necessities):    
a percentange increase in income has a smaller percentage increase in quantity demanded  
income **inelastic** demand  

YED > 1 (luxuries):  
income **elastic** demand  
a percentage increase in income = a larger percentage increase in quantity demanded  
the percentage of income spent on these items *increases faster* than income  

more travel, luxury cars, etc.  

### Engel Curve
a good turns from a normal good to an inferior good  
for normal goods, the slope is positive  
for inferior goods, the slop is negative  
at YED = 0, the slops is undefined  

### YED Implications for Producers and the Economy
as countries experience economic growth, goods with an income elastic demand will grow  
if society's income has grown by 3%, income spent on travel may be 4%  

for necessities (income inelastic demand), such as clothes and foods, growth may be at 2%  

the higher then YED for a good or service, the greater the expansion in the market  
the lower the YED, the smaller the expansion  

producers interested in producing in an expanding market may want to know their product's YED  

in a recession, luxuries are hit the hardest, whereas necessities (with low YEDs), have a smaller drop in sales  

### Economic Sectors
primary sector - primary products  
manufacturing sectors - cars  
services sectors - travel, banking, insurance  

as the economy grows, the size of these 3 sectors will grow in different ways  

agricultural products grow slowly than the growth in income (YED < 1)  
manufactured goods grow faster than economic growth (YED > 1)  

synthetic goods have a higher percentage of income spent on them as income rises (YED > 1)  

many services have a higher YED, so the percentage demand for these is much larger  

economies in less developed countries usually have a large primary sector due to the important of agriculture,
while manufactured goods or services are less important  

# Oct. 4, 2024

## Price Elasticity of Supply
measures how much the quantity supplied of a good responds to a change in its price  

**elasticity of supply** = % change in quantity supplied / % change in price  

PES < 1 - inelastic supply  
quantity supplied does not change much when price changes  
difficult and expensive to increase production  

Ex: supply of gold  

PES > 1 - elastic supply  
large response in the change in quantity supplied when price rises  
easy and inexpensive to increase production  

Ex: snow-shoveling services  

PES = 0 - perfectly inelastic supply  
quantity supplied does not respond to change in price (antiques)  

PES = infinity - perfectly elastic supply  
producers are willing to supply an unlimited good at a price but nothing below that price  

PES = 1 - unit elastic supply  
percentage quantity supplied is identical to percentage change in price  

Ex:  
price increases by 10% -> quantity supplied will also increase by 10%  

### Factors Influencing Elasticy of Supply 
- availability of additional resources -> the more resources, the more elastic  
- mobility of resources -> the easier to shift resources, the more elastic  
- spare (unused) capacity of firms -> the more idle equipment, the more elasitc  
- ability to store stock -> the more that can be stored, the more elastic  
- time production takes -> the shorter the time produciton takes, the more elastic  
- rate at which costs increase -> the slower the rate at which costs increase, the more elastic  

# Oct. 23, 2024 - Government Intervention

## Why Do Governments Intervene?
- earn revenue (indirect taxes)
- provide support to firms (subsidies)
- support households with low incomes
- influence production level of firms 
- influence consumption of households and consumers (**merit vs. demerit goods**)
- correct market failure (allocative efficiency)
- promote *equity* in the market system 

## How Do Governments Intervene?
- price controls (**price ceilings and price floors**)
- indirect taxes 
- subsidies
- direct provision of services 
- command and control regulation and legislation 
- consumer nudge 

## Price Controls
**price controls** - the minimum or maximum price set by the government (or private organizations) so that prices are 
*unable* to adjust to equilibrium levels as determined by supply and demand  

**market-clearing price** - a price where there is no shortages or surplus (Qd = Qs)  
market disequilibrium causes this  

## Price Ceilings
the government establishes a **legal maximum price**  
the legal price charged by sellers can not be higher than the legal maximum price  

### Benefits
- price falls, making the good more **affordable**  
- slows inflation, when prices rise much faster than wages in society

### Consequences
- underallocation of resources to the good (allocative inefficiency)
- shortages (price set is under the equilibrium, thus goods are "too easy" to get)
- non-price rationing 
- underground / parallel markets 
- negative welfare impacts (shortages, reduced quality, black markets -> make the consumer / producer experience worse)

Ex: rent control  
max price on rent set by government, demand rises, tenants illegally charge more (black market)  

### Consequences for the Economy and Stakeholders
refer to slideshow

consumers able to buy at the lower price are better off, but some are unsatisfied as there is not enough of the good to satisfy demand  
producers are worse off as they are now selling a smaller quantity at a lower price, lowering revenue (loss of producer surplus)
some workers are fired due to less output, workers are worse off  
government does not gain or lose money, but main gain popularity amongst those consumers who benefited  

### Calculating Effects Of Price Ceilings
**expenditure** - how much money is spent  
change is always calculated as **final - initial**  

welfare loss is given by the area of triangles **b + d** (refer to physical notes)  

derive all formulas using triangle and trapezoid area formulas, or refer to physical notes  
A (triangle) = (bh) / 2  
A (trapezoid / trapezium) = h/2 \* (b1 + b2)  

# Oct. 24, 2024

## Price Floors
**price floor** - a legal minimum price usually set above the equilibrium price; prevents prices from being too low  

benefits producers by allowing them to make more profits  
benefits workers, in the case of minimum wage  

Ex:  
alcohol has a price floor to minimize over consumption  

Pros:  
- businesses make more money and get higher profit margins
- for minimum wage, workers get more money  

Cons:  
- businesses may overproduce (surplus)  
- government may have to buy this surplus and dispose of it off the market (agriculture)  
- for minimum wage, workers may have a tough time finding work (finding a job is higher in demand)  
may lead to a black market for employment  

farmer incomes are often unstable or too low in some countries  
government may add a price floor above the equilibrium price, known as **price supports**  

### How do Governments Dispose of Surpluses?
- store it (but will raise prices due to storage costs)
- sell abroad (but lower the price as those abroad may not want to buy it at such a high price -> government will lose money)
- aid developing countries (no benefit)  

governments do not benefit when getting rid of surpluses  

### Consequences for the Economy
negative welfare impacts  
producer surplus increases, but consumer surplus decreases  

consumers - worse off, higher price for goods  
producers - better off, higher price and produces more since the government buys their surplus  
workers - better off, employment increases due to the great production of goods  
government - worse off, has to purchase excess supply  
other countries - worse off, misallocation of resources  

# Oct. 28, 2024 - Minimum Wage

minimum wage is a variation of a floor price  
how does this affect the labour force?  

many countries have minimum wage laws  

guarantees an adequate income for low income, low skilled workers  
aims to provide workers with a livable wage  

is set **above** the equilibrium wage to ensure workers earn enough to meet basic living standards  

## Impact of Minimum Wages on Markets
Supply and Demand:  
D = the quantity of labour firms are willing and able to hire  
S = the quantity of labour that workers supply at each wage  

## Consequences on the Economy 
causes a labour surplus and unemployment  
more people want to work at the minimum wage than there are jobs available (workers are more enticed)  

firms hire less as hiring becomes more expensive  
firms rather higher less workers with more skills (which may cost more than minimum wage) to complete a task  

- illegal immigrants may immigrate and get paid below minimum wage
- misallocation of labour resources - low skilled workers are hired less (higher-skilled workers are hired more instead as they contribute 
more to the firmś output)  
- misallocation in product markets - increased cost in labour can disrupt the production of pricing of products
(less unskilled workers = less production)  

### Welfare Impacts  
the area between market equilibrium and quantity demanded is lost  

### Stakeholder Impacts 
- firms - worse off, higher costs of production 
- workers - gain / lose (some gain higher wages from their employers even if they are above minimum wage, but some workers lose due to higher
unemployment)  
- consumers - worse off, increased price of labour = decreased supply of products = higher price of products available  

# Nov. 4, 2024 

**indirect taxes** are paid by consumers to the government, but the tax is partly paid for by consumers, hence indirect  

2 types of indirect tax:  
- **excise taxes** - taxes imposed on particular goods such as gas, cigarettes, etc. (the opposite of a **subsidy**)  
harmful goods may have excise taxes to reduce consumption, such as alcohol or cigarettes  
- taxes on all (or most) goods and services, such as value added tax (HST)  

## Why do Governments Impose Indirect Taxes?
R - source of government revenue   
A - improve allocaiton of resources by correcting market imperfections and negative externalities  
I - redistribute income (ensure the wealthy contribute more to government income)  
D - discourage consumption of harmful goods  

## Types of Indirect Taxes
- specific taxes - fixed amount of tax per unit (ex: $5 per pack of cigarettes)  
- ad valorem taxes ("according to the value") - a fixed percentage of the price of the good or service, tax increases as the price of the
product increases (ex: property tax)  

## Consequences for Stakeholders
- consumers - worse off, increase in price of goods and decrease in quantity they buy  
- producers - worse off, fall in price they receive and fall in quantity of output they sell -> fall in revenue  
- government - better off, earns revenue off of taxes  
- workers - worse off, lower output of goods -> less workers needed to produce the quantity of goods -> unemployement  
- society as a whole - worse off, underallocation of resources to the production of goods, loss of welfare and social surplus  

# Nov. 5, 2024 - Subsidies

**subsidy** - assistance provided by the government to individuals or groups (firms, consumers, etc.)  
can be a cash payment or other forms of assistance (low-interest / interest-free loans, tax relief, etc.)  

change allocation of resources as they affect prices (signals and incentives)  

subsidy to firms increases the price received by producers, thus causing firms to produce more and charge less  
results in **greater** production and consumption than in the free market  

## Why do Governments Grant Subsidies?
- gives subsidies to producers they would like to support by increasing a firm's revenue (ex: farmers)  
- makes certain goods (necessities) affordable to low income earners  
- encourage production and consumption of products that are believed to be desirable to consumers (ex: education and vaccinations)  
- support growth of a particular industry in the economy (ex: solar industry)  
- encourage exports (makes goods easier to produce and sell abroad, boosting exports)  
- improve allocation of resources by correcting positive externalities (when produciton of a good causes benefit to a third party)  

## Controversy
subsidies may achieve objectives that are not consistent with other objectives  

Ex:  
subsidies to fossil fuels contradicts sustainable development goals and conflicts with susbisides meant to promote alternative energy  

## Consequences for Stakeholders
- consumers - better off, fall in price and increase in quantity purchased  
- producers - better off, receive higher prices and produce larger quantities -> increase in revenue  
- government - worse off, the government pays the subsidy, is a burden on the budget  
- workers - better off, producers increase output, firms are more likely to hire more workers  
- foreign producers - worse off, unable to compete with lower price of the subsidized domestic goods  
- society as a whole - worse off, overallocation of resources to the production of the product  

# Nov. 11, 2024 - Market Failures and Socially Undesirable Outcomes

**common pool resources (CPR)** - resources not owned by anyone, they do not have a price and are available to use without 
payment or other restrictions (ex: clean air, clean water, etc.)  

CPR differs from other resources as it is both **rivalrous and *non*-excludable**  

a private good has two characteristics:  
**rivalrous** - one person's use of the resource reduces its availability for others  
**excludable** - it is possible to exclude people from using the good  
**non-excludable** - it is not possible to exclude someone from using a good or resource  

CPR can easily be overused, leading to environmental degredation and depletion  
therefore, policy makers need to be concerned about how much is being used  

restrictions may then be imposed on CPR  

**externality** - an indirect effect of an economic activity that affects third parties who are not directly involved in the activity  

**sustainability** - the use of resources in ways that do not result in fewer or lower quality for future generations  

**constant average yield** - each unit of input produces the same amount of output consistently, regardless of the level of input used  
**decreasing average yield** - each unit of input produces less amount of output (there is still a gain in output)  
**absolutely decreasing yield** - each unit of input proucess less output  

**maximum sustainable yield** - the boundary between the decreasing average yield and the absolutely decreasing yield  

# Nov. 13, 2024 - Market Failure and Externalities: Diverging Private and Social Benefits and Costs

in a free and competitive market, allocative efficiency is when MB = MC  
however, this is almost never met in the real world  

**market failure** - the failure of the market to allocative resources efficiently  
caused when people acting purely in their own self-interest  
leads to outcomes that aren't efficient and could be improved to benefit society as a whole  

economists are often concerned with the cause and possible means of correction for market failures  
however, government policy interventions (taxes, subsidies, regulations, bailouts, etc.) may lead to 
allocative inefficiency, called **government failure**  

## Externalities
an **externality** occurs when the actions of consumers or producers create unintended positive or negative side effects
that impact others (third parties) who are not part of those actions and whose interests were **not** considered  

positive externality - external benefit to society (**external spillover benefit**)  
negative externality - external costs to society (**external spillover cost**)  

Ex: positive externality  
high-rise buildings around the roger's stadium can look into the stadium for free  

Ex: negative externality  
air pollution from a factory affecting the residential areas around it  

types of externalities:  
- negative production externalities
- positive production externalities  
- negative consumptions externalities  
- positive consumptions externalities  

## Marginal Benefits And Costs
- marginal private cost (MPC) - cost to producers for producing one more unit of a good  
- marginal social cost (MSC) - cost to society of producing one more unit of a good  
- marginal private benefit (MPB) - benefit to consumers for consuming one more unit of a good
- marginal social benefit (MSB) - benefit to society for consuming one more unit of good  

**social optimum** - refers to the **best** situation from the pont of view of **allocative efficiency**  
**socially optimum** output - Q value at the social optimum  

however, when there is an externality, MSB and MSC will differ from MPB and MPC  
marginal cost is a result of **opportunity cost**  

# Nov. 18, 2024 - Negative Production Externalities

**negative externalities** - negative effects created by producers to third parties  
ex: environmental pollution  

creates a **spillover cost** - additional costs that spill over onto society  
the **marginal social cost** refers to the cost of producing that good and the cost onto society  

the market does not care for these externalities, thus in a good with a negative externality, there is an overallocation of resources  
harm to society is caused, thus a loss in **welfare**  

## Policies to Correct Negative Production Externalities
none of these policies are perfect  
governments may impose an **indirect tax** to increase the MPC  

### Carbon Tax
a tax on greenhouse gas emissions (per unit tax on the emissions of fossil fuels by carbon emitted; more carbon emitted => higher the tax)  
incentivizes firms to switch to less polluting energy sources  

### Tradeable Permits
permits to pollute that can be bought and traded in the market  

government grants each firm a particular number of permits to produce a particular level of pollutants over a given period of time  
permits to pollute are determined by supply and demand  

the supply is **perfectly inelastic**  

the total pollution that is permitted based on the pollution permits must be less than the amount of pollution with no permits  

as the economy grows and the firms increase their output level, demand is likely to increase  
similar to taxes on emissions in that they provide *incentives* to switch to less polluting resources  

if a firm finds a way to reduce emissions, it can sell its permit  

### Government Based Policies
government rely on the "command" approach where the government uses its authority to enact legislation in the public's interest to prevent
or reduce the effects of production externalities  

ex: capping the amount of pollution a factories may produce  

goals of government policies is to move the **MPC curve to the MSC curve**  

# Nov. 20, 2024 - Negative Consumption Externalities

**negative consumption externality** - external costs created by consumers (ex: smoking in public, heaing homes / driving cars using fossil fuels)  
when there is a consumption externality, the **marginal private benefit does not reflect the social benefits**  

the distance between the MPB and MSB is the external cost  
loss of welfare due to overallocation of resources  

## Demerit Goods
**demerit goods** - goods that are considered undesirable for consumers, but which are overprovided by the market (ex: cigarettes)  
consumers buy "too many" of these products as they are ignorant or simply do not care  

## Correcting Negative Consumption Externalities

### Market Based Policies
imposing indirect taxes  
if the tax equals the external cost, the output decreases to the optimal quantity  

### Government Legislation and Regulation
can be used to limit consumer activities that impose costs on third parties  
Ex:  
- restrictions of where people can smoke
- age restrictions for sellers  

MPB shifts to MSB (lowered demand)  
this would eliminate the externality  

### Education and Awareness-Creation
a part of government legislation and regulation  

awareness of the product's effects can be used to try to persuade consumers to buy fewer goods with negative externalities  
ex: showing the effects of smoking on the cigarette packages  

lowers demand, shifting the MPB to MSB  
the original distance between MPB and MSB is the external cost  

## Nudges
**nudges** - a form of behavioural economics involving the design of methods to influence consumers' behaviour  

similar to educating consumers, encourages consumers to rely less on goods with negative externalities  
Ex: placing unhealthy foods at he back of the store  

# Nov. 22, 2024 - Positive Externalities

## Positive Production Externalities
**positive externalities of production** - external benefits created by producers  
Ex:  
a technology being developed by a firm becomes widespread (firm and all of society benefits)  

MSC curve is lower than the MPC curve  
this creates an **underallocation** of resources toward the good => too little is being produced  

this creates a welfare loss (the difference between the MSB and MSC curves for the amount of output that is underproduced relative
to the social optimum)  
external benefits for society are lost because not enough of the good is produced  

## Correcting Positive Production Externalities

### Direct Government Provision
government directly produces this good or service with their own funds  
Ex:  
government engages in resesarch and development in pharmaceuticals  

### Subsidies
government provides a subsidy to incentivize higher production  
pushes the MPC curve to the MSC curve  

# Nov. 25, 2024 - Positive Consumption Externalities

a consumer consuming a good creates a positive, external benefits   
Ex:  
- consumption of education (better educated workfore => reduce unemployment, less crime)    
- consumption of health care (healthier population, higher standard of living, not spreading disease to the rest of society, etc.)    

MSB thus lies **above** the MPB  
the distance between the curves is the **external benefit**  

social optimal quantity thus increases  
therefore, there is an underallocation of resources, and too little of the product is being produced  

Ex:  
vaccinations - people only consider MPC and MPB, but not considering the benefit to society (herd immunity)  
too few people are thus getting vaccinated  

for positive externalities, the welfare loss triangle points to the right, in negative externalities, the
welfare loss triangle points to the left  

## Merit Goods
goods and services that are desirable to consumers but are under-provided and under-consumed by the market  

under-consumption is caused by:  
- good may have positive exteranlities (too little produced by the market)  
- low levels of income and poverty  
- consumer ignorance  

## Correcting Positive Consumption Externalities

### Legislation
can be used to promote larger consumption of goods (ex: mandatory education in ontario until 16)  
MPB ideally shifts to MSB (an increase in demand)  

### Advertising
used to educate the public (increase awareness)  
persuades consumers to buy more of a good with a positive externality (ex: using a sports facility)  

increases demand => MPB shifts to MSB  

### Nudges
similar effect to educaiton and awareness creation  

ex: creating a bicycle lane to "nudge" consumers to bike more  
aims to shift MPB to MSB  

### Direct Government Provision
ex: providing healthcare and education  

the government itself will produce the goods and service itself  
shifts the supply curve to the right (**increase in supply**)  

increased supply => decreases prices => incentivizes consumers to consumer more of the good with a positive consumption externality  
**allocative efficiency** is achieved  

### Subsidies
similar to direct government provision as it **increases supply**  
supply shifts to the right  

if the subsidies is equal to the external benefit, **allocative efficiency** is achieved  

# Nov. 26, 2024

## Market Faiure and Public Goods
public goods have two characteristics:   
- non-rivalrous   
- non-excludable  

Ex: police force, national defense, fire protection, non-toll roads  

**free-rider problem** - when people can enjoy goods without paying for them (non-excludability)  
is a type of **market failure** (firms do not produce this product because they do not benefit,
thus firms *underallocate* resources to producing this good)   

**quasi-public goods** - neither a public nor private good (non-rivalrous but excludable or vice versa)  
Ex: toll roads, museum entrance fee (excludable, but non-rivalrous)  

**government** must decide *what* is produced and at *what quantity*  
may contract out to the private sector with **advantages / disadvantages**  

### Contracting Out
governments may decide to contract out to the private sector to provide public goods instead of producing the goods themselves  

**benefits**:  
- competitive tendering => allows government to choose the vendor with the lowest price possible  
- specific details and specifications => possibly higher quality  
- broader range of skills and technology in the private firm  
- private firm may be more flexible and innovative than the government  
overall, contracting out may be cheaper and may provide higher quality  

**drawbacks**:  
- government becomes less accountable for the goods it provides  
- government loses control over the services it contracts out  
- contracting out may be **more expensive** than producing the service internally  
- quality may be reduced due to firms trying to cut costs  
- there exists the risk of entering a poor contracts leading to higher costs and lower quality  
- contracting out requires constant government supervision, which adds to costs  
overall, contracting out may lead to higher costs and lower quality  

thus, it is difficult to **generalize the effectiveness of contracting out**  

contracting out does not address **which goods to produce and how much to produce**  

## Asymmetric Information
**asymmetric information** - when buyers and sellers **do not** have **equal** access to information  

two problems because of asymmetric information:  
- **adverse selection** - when one party in a transaction has more information about the quality of the product being sold than the other party  
(ex: risks on buying a product, but the consumer does not know the risks)  
- **moral hazard** - when one party takes risks, but does not face the full cost of these risks because the full cost are borne by the other party
(ex: people with car insurance may be less prudent in avoiding getting their car stolen)  

moral hazard thus leads to an **underallocation of resources** as firms try to protect themselves against the risky behaviours of consumers  
(ex: a person with a high-cost health insurance policy with a low deductible will be more willing to take on risks relating to their health)  

### Correcting Asymmetric Information

#### Adverse Selection
**when the seller knows more than the buyer**:  
- the government may regulate the quality of products sold by the buyer (ex: food regulations)  
- the government may directly supply information on the product or mandate that the sellers provide information  
- the government may require licensing to ensure a certain quality or competence (ex: doctors)  

however, the first two incur a large cost and strain on the government budget due to the cost of monitoring, and thus
also a large opportunity cost  
the third option may reduce supply, thus raising the cost of these services (such as increasing income), which is at the expense
of the consumer  

**private responses include**:  
- screening (trying to get more information on the product via the internet or other means)  
- signalling (when the seller willingly gives information to the buyer in order to entice them, ex: providing a warranty, creating 
a reputable brand name)  

**when buyer knows more than the seller**:  
- the government may directly provide the service (ex: health insurance and loans, buyer knows more than seller)  
- seller may attempt to screen buyer (ex: different deductibles for health insurance)  

Ex:  
a low-cost policy for health insurance with a high deductible aims to target those who do not get sick easy,
a high-cost policy with a low deductible targets those who do  

a health insurance company may use this to **screen** their buyers  

however, low income individuals will always buy the low-cost policy, thus making screening **ineffective**  
furthermore, the health insurance companies may refuse to ensure the eldery  

an **inequity** thus arises, as those who need health insurance either do not get it (the eldery) or not enough of it (the poor)  

#### Moral Hazard
**moral hazard in the financial area is normally corrected through government intervention**  
Ex:  
financial crisis of 2008, firms took risky loans thinking the government would bail them out, and the government did  

in order to avoid such a situation again, **regulation** is created by the government  

# Nov. 27, 2024 - Equity in the Distribution of Income and Wealth

**equality** - state of being equal with respect to something  
**equity** - the idea of being fair and just  
note the difference between the two  

the pursuit of equity normally means reducing significant inequalities in income and wealth  

the problem of income distribution arises because ownership of the **factors of production** that houses own and the **prices** of those
factors vary greatly (ex: selling labour vs selling labour with special skills)  

people may also not be hired due to lacking skills wanted by firms, or because they are old, sick, etc.  
there may also be a lack of jobs in the economy  
some may have **more factors of production than others**, e.g. land, capital, entrepreneurial abilities  

thus, **market based distribution of income** is prone to varying greatly amongst individuals  
therefore, the free market can not ensure that everyone will have enough income to satisfy basic needs  

**redistribution** - methods used by the government to alter the market-determined distribution of income and output  

**wealth** - money or things of value that people own (ex: savings, stocks, bonds, etc.) minus debt  
income => savings => wealth  
however, not necessarily related, as people can have high incomes but save little, leading to little wealth  

despite that, income and wealth are still closely related, and thus income equalities lead to wealth inequalities  

**strictly speaking, the inability for the market to provide enough income for all to satisfy their basic needs is *not* an
instance of market failure** 

market failure is when the market can not achieve allocative efficiency, which as a result, leads to a loss in social surplus and thus welfare  
therefore market failure does not imply income or wealth inequality  
**it is perfectly possible to have allocative efficiency and maximum social surplus whilst either having complete income equality
or complete income inequality, such as having a large part of the population be starving**  

# Dec. 2, 2024 - Firms and Market Structures

## Market Power
**firm** - an organization that employs factors of production to produce and sell goods or services  
**industry** - a group of one or more firms (ex: car, shoe, banking industries, etc.)  
**market structures** - describes characteristics of a market's organization that determines the behaviour of firms  

the main difference between different market structures is the **extent to which each firm in the industry is able to
control the price at which it sells its products**  

**the greater the market power of a firm, the greater the allocative inefficiency**  

## Market Structures
**market** - a group of buyers and sellers of a particular good or service  

what determines market structure?  
- number of firms in the market  
- product differentiation
- how easy it is for a firm to enter (barriers to entry) and leave the market  

there are **four** types of market structures  

### Perfect Competition
- many firms  
- each sells an identical product (ex: natural resources and agriculture)  
- many buyers  
- no barriers to entry  
- both firms and buyers are well-informed of prices and products of all firms in the industry  

### Monopoly
**note - no true monopolies exist anymore**  

- one firm produces the entire output of the industry  
- no close substitutes for the product  
- barriers to entry exists for new firms, thus protecting the monopolozing firm from competition  

Ex:  
old microsoft monopolizing operating systems  

### Monopolistic Competition
the type of market structure **most commonly seen in day-to-day life**  

- many firms  
- each firm produces a similar but slightly different product (**product differentiation**)  
- each firm possesses an element of market power  
- no barriers to entry for new firms  

### Oligopoly
- **small number** of firms compete  
- firms produce either almost identical products or differentiated products  
- barriers to entry exist to limit entry  

Ex:  
airline industry, pharmaceuticals  

# Dec. 3, 2024 - Profit Maximization by a Rational Producer

**revenue** - the income a firm receives from the sale of the goods and services it produces  

there are **3** types of revenue:  
- total revenue (TR) - multiplying the selling price by the units of good solve (P \* Q)  
- marginal revenue (MR) - additional revenue from the sale of an additional unit of output (ΔTR / ΔQ)  
- average revenue (AR) - average revenue per unit of output sold (TR / Q)  

**two situations**:  
- firms are unable to control price (perfect competition, since all firms produce identical goods, no one will buy at an increased price)  
- firm has control over their prices (monopolisitic competition, oligopoly, monopoly)  

## Revenue Curves
firms can either control or not control prices based off their market power  

calculate marginal revenue, total revenue, and average revenue based off the given date (units of product sold
and the price the product is sold at)  

**note** - the graph of the marginal revenue is the graph of the derivative of the total revenue

# Dec. 5, 2024

**cost** - the cost of the factors of productions to produce output  

all the cost formulas are **cost / quantity**  
- marginal cost - the cost of producing one more unit of output  
- total cost - the total cost of producing all the current units of output  
- average cost - the average cost of all the units of output currently produced  

in the short run, there is at least **one fixed factor of production**  
in the long run, **all factors of production are available to be reallocated and shifted around**   

# Dec. 12, 2024

## The Long-Run
short-run average cost curves are changed into new SRAC curves as time / output increasing due to firms increasing their **factors of production**  
a growth in any factor of production can be viewed as an entire reallocation of factors of production, thus putting the firm in the long-run,
and thus a new SRAC curve is created  

all the SRAC curves are connected by a LRAC (long-run average cost) curve that is tangent to minimum of each of the infinite SRAC curves  

**constant returns to scale** - output increases in the same proportion as all inputs  
Ex:  
doubling input will double output  

LRAC is similar to a parbola, with a descending section (**economies of scale**), minimum, and ascending section (**diseconomies of scale**)  

the **descending section** is due to:  
- specialization of labour => better efficiency of workers  
- specialization of management => greater efficiency and lower costs  
- bulk buying of inputs (factors of production) => price per unit of input drops  
- financing economics => large firms may have lower interest rates  
- spreading certain costs (ex: marketing) over larger volume of output => certain costs now cost less per unit of output due to increased output
and constant price of certain costs  

the **ascending section** of the LRAC (increase in long-run average cost) is due to:  
- coordination and monitoring difficulties => growing inefficiencies  
- communication difficulties => inefficiencies and higher average costs  
- poor worker motivation => inefficiency and higher average costs  

## Profit
profit = revenue - economic costs  

which is,  
profit = total revenue - (explicit costs + implicit costs)  

**explicit cost** - the cost of buying factors of production and resources  
**implicit cost** - the opportunity cost of using a firm's factors of production and resources  

**profit maximization** - determing the level of output that the firm should produce to make profit as large as possible  
**loss** - negative profit; the firm is losing money  

in the case of a loss, before the firm goes out of business, the firm will be interested in producing the quantity of output minimizing the loss  

two methods to analyzing profit maximization:  
- using **total revenues and total costs** 
- using **marginal revenues and marginal costs**  

### Using Total Revenues and Total Costs
profit = TR - TC  
TC is the firm's economic costs (explicit + implicit)  

**profit maximization is where TR - TC is as large as possible**  
numerical profit is also = TR - TC  

- positive profit (TR > TC) => **abnormal profit**  
- zero profit (TR = TC) => **normal profit** 
- negatie profit (TR < TC) => **loss**  

**normal profit** - the minimum amount of revenue a firm can receive to keep the business running  
profit is 0, and the revenue covers **all economic costs (explicit and implicit)**  

normal profit also **includes the payment for entrepreneurship**  
entrepreneurs still **receive a payment** for what they do, thus they are still incentivized to run their business  

Ex: owning a pizza shop  
despite the pizza shop being in normal profit, as a business owner (entrepreneur), you are still paid for your output (normal
profit **accounts for the factor of production *entrepreneurship***), and thus you are still incentivized to produce output  

### Using Marginal Revenues and Marginal Costs
**profit maximization is when MR = MC**  
the revenue (benefit) from one more unit of output is equal to the cost (drawback) of one more unit of output  

therefore, maximum profit occurs at **MR = MC**  

however, whether this is **profit-maximization or loss-minimization** can **not** be determined without more information  
numerical amount of profit / loss-minimization can also not be found  

# Dec. 17, 2024 - Perfect Competition

to the **producer** of goods with perfect competition, demand is **completely elastic**  

any increase in the price you sell at, will lead to no sales  
a decrease in price leads to a loss in revenue / profit    

the firm is a **price-taker**  

**P = MR = AR**  
constant at all levels for perfect competition  
forms a **linear relationship**  

makes **two** decisions in the short-run:  
- whether to produce or shut down (based off profit)  
- if the firm does decide to produce, what quantity to produce?  

## Profit Maximization in the Short-Run
firm will always try to maximize profit  
since firms can not change the price, firms rely on **setting a quantity** as the tool to measure total profit  

firm will use **marginal revenue and marginal cost rule**  

if MR > MC:
    economic profit increases if output increases  
else if MR < MC:
    economic profit decreases if output increases  
else:
    economic profit decreases if output changes in either direction => profit is maximized  

### Steps to Maximize Profit  
- find where MR = MC  
**recall: P = MR = AR in perfect competition**  
- compare AR to AC to determine type of profit (or loss) per unit of output  
i.e. abnormal, normal, or negative profit  
- find total profit (or total loss) - profit = TR - TC  

### Abnormal Profit
making more than the cost of the factors of production  

abnormal profit is distance between AR and AC  
TR > TC  

### Normal Profit
AR and AC intersect at AC's minimum  
TR = TC  

in the long-run, all firms in perfect competition make a **normal profit**  
profits / losses in the short-run lead to entry and exits of firm, leading normal profit on average  

### Loss Minimization
loss is difference between AC and AR  
TR < TC  

# Dec. 18, 2024 - Monopolies (Part 1)

monopolies are the extreme opposite of perfect competition  

## Barriers to Entry
- economies of scale
- natural monopolies
- branding
- legal barriers
- control of essential resources
- aggressive tactics

### Economies of Scale
steep curve in the economies of scale section of the LRAC curve  

average costs decrease as firm increases in size  
large startup costs  

### Natural Monopolies
**natural monopolies** - firms that have economies of scale so large they can produce for an entire market and still not
exhaust their economies of scale  

### Branding
**branding** - creation by a firm of a unique image and name of a product  

works through advertising to influence customers to establish customer loyalty => convinces them of product superiority  
makes it difficult for new firms to enter the market that is dominated by a successful brand  

### Legal Barriers
given by the government to protect the firm, such as:  
- copyrights - author has the sole rights to print / publish work  
- licenses - granted for particular professions or industries  
- patents - rights given to a firm that has developed a new product 
- quotas / tariffs / trade restrictions - limit the quantities of a good that can be imported into another country  
(makes it difficult for foreign firms from entering a domestic market)  

**limits competition and contribution to market power**  

### Control of Essential Resources
ownership of a natural resources is monopolized by one company, either through geography or contracts  

Ex: De Beers (diamond company that used to have a monopoly)  

## Demand Curve
monopolies are **price-makers** due to significant **market power**  
all firms, **except** perfect competition, are price-makers  

allows firms to basically price products at whatever they want  

**market power arises whenever a firm faces a downward-sloping demand curve**  

due to marginal diminishing utility, more output **can only be sold at a lower price**  

**when MR is at 0, TR is at its maximum**  
proof:  
since the MR curve is the derivative of the TR curve, when MR is equal to 0, TR is at a maximum  

# Jan. 13, 2025 - Monopolies (Part 2)

the marginal revenue (MR) curve will always be less than the AR (demand / MB) curve  
this is due to firms having to lower the price of all previous units of product to increase the quantity sold  

at equilibrium, MB > MC, implying an **underallocation resources**, and thus a welfare loss  

thus, market power is proportional to market failure  
market power can thus be defined as **a firm's ability to change price (MB) to a price greater than MC**  
this only occurs in a **downward sloping demand curve**  

thus, private monopolies are usually illegal due to the cost towards society  

## Criticisms of Monopolies
- welfare loss, allocative inefficiency, market failure  
- higher price and lower output  
- loss of consumer surplus that is gained by the monopolizing firm  
- negative impacts on distribution of income (consumers pay more and firm owners make more)  
- lack of competition => less concern for maintaining low costs of production => higher costs  
**X-inefficiency** - the concern in maintaining abnormal profits in the long-run over favouring low costs of production  
- less innovation - no pressure to innovate due to high barriers to entry unlike monopolistic competition  

## Benefits of Monopolies
- economies of scale - allow for cheaper costs of production as monopolies grow => possible lower prices for products  
- natural monopoly - low average costs for firm => cheaper goods for consumers  
- research and development (r&d) for products and technology  
  - large abnormal profits allow for financing of r&d projects  
  - high barriers to entry allow firms to enjoy profits from their innovation    
  - product development and technological innovation help maintain abnormal profits by creating another barrier to entry
