## sept 4, 2024 - Intro to Economics

Economics is a social science, i.e., it uses the scientific method to learn more about human interaction and society

### Scarcity
Economics is the study of choices on scarce resources, as human wants are infinite, but available resources are finite

### Factors of Production
- Land (gifts of nature)
- Labour
- Capital (manmade resources to boost production)
- Entrepreneurship (innovate by developing new ways of doing things; takes on risk of success or failure of a business)

### Other meanings of 'capital'
- Physical (one of the factors of production)
- Human (skills acquired by people -> more productivity)
- Natural (expnds the factor of production 'land', necessary for human survival and opportunity)
- Financial (investments and purchases of financial instruments, i.e. stocks and bonds)

### Opportunity Cost
exists as resources, like time and money, are scarce  
the value of the best altnerative that given up to obtain something else  

### Free and Economic Goods
free good - a good that is not scarce, and thus has an opportunity cost of 0  

economic good - a good that is scarce, either because it itself is a naturally scarce resource, or because it is produced by scarce resources  
as a result, all economic goods have an opportunity cost greater than 0  

a free good for one may be an economic good for another (clean air, airable soil)  

### Free good vs a good free of charge
natural resources (known as a common pool resource) are free of a charge, but are an economic resource because they are scarce,
and are becoming more scarce due to overuse and depletion  

services provided by the government are seemingly "free", but are produced by scarce resources, funded by tax revenues
