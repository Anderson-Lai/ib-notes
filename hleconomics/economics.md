# Sept. 4, 2024 - Intro to Economics  
  
Economics is a social science, i.e., it uses the scientific method to learn more about human interaction and society  
  
## Scarcity  
Economics is the study of choices on scarce resources, as human wants are infinite, but available resources are finite  
  
## Factors of Production  
- Land (gifts of nature)  
- Labour  
- Capital (manmade resources to boost production)  
- Entrepreneurship (innovate by developing new ways of doing things; takes on risk of success or failure of a business)  
  
## Other meanings of 'capital'  
- Physical (one of the factors of production)  
- Human (skills acquired by people -> more productivity)  
- Natural (expnds the factor of production 'land', necessary for human survival and opportunity)  
- Financial (investments and purchases of financial instruments, i.e. stocks and bonds)  
  
## Opportunity Cost  
exists as resources, like time and money, are scarce    
the value of the best altnerative that was given up to obtain something else    
  
## Free and Economic Goods  
free good - a good that is not scarce, and thus has an opportunity cost of 0    
  
economic good - a good that is scarce, either because it itself is a naturally scarce resource, or because it is produced by scarce resources    
as a result, all economic goods have an opportunity cost greater than 0    
  
a free good for one may be an economic good for another (clean air, airable soil)    
  
## Free good vs a good free of charge  
natural resources (known as a common pool resource) are free of a charge, but are an economic resource because they are scarce,  
and are becoming more scarce due to overuse and depletion    
  
services provided by the government are seemingly "free", but are produced by scarce resources, funded by tax revenues  
  
# Sept. 5, 2024 - What is Economics?

how to supply our wants with our limited resources?  
how do we allocate our resources efficiently and sustainably?  

main questions:
- what items, products, goods, or services to produce over others?
- how should we produce these items?
- for whom do we produce these items, and how much of said item do we give them?

Canada has a mixed market economy (partly controlled by the government and sellers)

characteristics:
- has a market and prices
- government influence
- control of what to put into the market

goals:
- income is distributed
- employ all available resources
- everyone is mostly employed 

## 9 key concepts:
- scarcity (how can resources be best used to satisfy wants and needs)
- choice (we need to choose what to produce, and what products are more important)
- efficiency (do not waste our limited resources, and fully employ our resources)
- equity (equally distributing income, wealth, and opportunity)
- economic well-being (health of economy enjoyed by the people)
- sustainability (using our resources wisely to not harm the opportunities of the future generations)
- change (understanding that the economic world is very fluid and is constantly in motion, our method of thinking must change on the situtation)
- interdependence (we are not self sufficient, and must rely on one another)
- intervention (government involvement in the working market)

## Scarcity and Choice
smart choices are needed to choose what to prioritize over the other, due to the limited nature of resources  

scaricty arises from limited money, time, and energy  
economics is the study of the choices leading to the best use of scarce resources to fulfill unlimited human wants and needs  

for society, all economic resources are scarce  
these resources come from human society and nature  

economic development is often achieved at the expense of the environment and natural resources  
overuse of these practices lead is unsustainable  

sustainability - using resources to produce goods whilst not making the resources any more scarce  

## Factors of Production  
- Land 
- Labour 
- Capital  
- Entrepreneurship  

Land - 'gifts of nature' used to produce goods  
resources may not be renewable, or take a long time to renew (sustainability)

labour - the work, time, and effort put into creating goods or services  
quality of labour (human capital) - the knowledge needed to provide a service or create a good  

capital - any machines, tools, instruments, or buildings used to create good and services  
we humans can not create everything by ourselves  

entrepreneurship - the human resources that organizes land, labour, and capital to produce goods and services  

these factors cause our resources, goods, and services to be scarce  

## 3 Economic Questions
- what
- how
- for whom 

### What do we produce first?  
how do we make said produce or provide a service? (do we need machines, human labour, money, or labour?)  

Resources Allocation - allocating resources properly to provide a good or service  
a change in the quantity of goods produced will involve a reallocation of resources (resources are limited)  

when a society produces too much of a good or service that is an overallocation of resources  

### What to produce?
objects that people value and products that satifies wants  
reallocation of resources will be needed (less farmers in Canada over the past 60 years)

what resources do we need to produce this product?  

### For whom to proudce?  
an economic goal is distributing goods equally (does not always happen)
how will goods and services be distributed to the population?  

# Sept. 9, 2024

## Opportunity Cost and Production
the expected value of the best altnerative  
all human choices require cost and tradeoff  
every good a nation produces faces a tradeoff of a good it can no longer produce  
how much of each product is a nation willing to produce to maximize its resources (guns and butter)  

## Making Economic Choices 
market vs command method  
- market (private companies making decisions)
- command (government makes the choices and not the businesses)

## Resource Allocation and Output/Input Distribution 
3 main questions are forced by scarcity:
- what/how much to produce 
- how to produce (machine to labour ratio, which technologies, which materials, what skills)
- produce for whom? (equality vs earned, should certain services/goods be distributed more evenly)

**What/How to produce -> resource Allocation**  
**Whom to produce -> distribution of output and income**  

## Resource Allocation 
assigning available resources or factors of production to specific uses amongst altneratives  
what is produced, and how much is produced  
if a change in the number of goods produced is made a reallocation is required (overallocation vs underallocation)  

## Distribution of Output
how much of the produced goods do certain individuals or groups receive  
related to **distribution of income**  
amount people can buy is directly related to how much income they have  
**Redistribution of income** - when social groups receive more, less, or input/output less than previously

## Free Market Economy, Planned Economy, Mixed Economy 
real world economies normally mix free market and planned economies (mixed economies)  

### Resource ownership: public vs private sector
public sector - government owned and controlled  
private sector - owned by individuals, businesses, non-government organizations  

free market economy - private sector resource ownership  
planned economy - public sector resource ownership  

### Economic decision-making  
what and how much is produced, for whom is something produced?  

free market - private sector determines the answers to these questions  
planned economy - government determines the answers to these questions

### Rationing System
**rationing** - method used to divide something amongst interested users

free market economy - **price rationing** is used to determine resource allocation and output/income distribution  
who receives what and how much they receive is based on the prices of goods and services  

planned economy - uses non-price rationing  
results from no markets or government intervention  
what/how much is produced, how it is produced, who will receive the output are determined by methods not related to prices in the market  

**In a free market economy, househoulds and firms control the resource and product markets**  
**A planned economy is marked by absence or limited operation of markets, the government makes all decisions on allocations and distribution of resources, goods, and services through methods that are not price rationing**  

## Mixed Economy and the Mixed Market Economy
public and private sector work together  
government normally makes decisions on activities under its ownership (parks, defense, etc.)  

however, government is not limited to just activities in its ownership  
United States government affects private sector via minimum wage, tax collection, anti-monopolative legislations, etc.  

government involvement is a response to the failure of the market mechanisms or to the demands or politically-powerful groups  
however, the extent to which the government is invovlved varies from country to country  

price rationing typically dominates over non-price rationing in mixed market economies  
in the absence of markets (public health care, defense systems, roads), non-price rationing occurs  
government acts as a central planner  
resources are distributed via non-price rationing (e.g. a queue for free healthcare)  

today, market-based activities have a higher popularity than central planning (less public sector involvement)  
supply-side policies and recognition of the limitations of central planning caused this shift in the 1980's

## Positive and Normative Statements 
Positive - a prediction or statement based on fact and observable factors  
Normative - an opinion or belief; can not be corroborated or disproved  

# Sept. 11, 2024

## Production Possibilities Model
**production possibilities frontier (ppf)** - boundary between goods and services that can be produced and those can not  
comparing two items together  

production efficiency - we cannot produce more of one good without producing less of some other good  
points on the frontier are inefficient  

areas under the frontier means we are wasting resources  
anything in the shaded area is attainable, but resources are not being used efficiently  
the resources are either unemployed or unallocated  

**tradeoff along the PPF**  
every choice along the PPF involved a tradeoff  
resources are redistributed when one item is produced less to produce more of another item  

## Opportunity Cost 
PPF makes the concept of opportunity cost more tangible  
opportunity cost of the increase in *x* is the absence / cost of not producing *y* [view an example here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MF3c82nT7CPF4KYsdnMZpAyBjjEtVOImBhxeu7bYm_g/edit#slide=id.g151038b80da_0_722)

Ex: if more pizzas are produced, less CDs must be produced; the opportunity cost of producing *x* pizzas is *y* CDs  

the PPF bows outward, it is concave (not all resources can be used as efficiently as other resources)  

to grow the PPF, we must have some form of economic growth (more labour, technological development, more raw materials, more capital (machinery))  
the curve thus would then expand, more of each product could now be produced  

# Sept. 12, 2024 - Demand

## The Market
any place where buys and sellers of good and services meet together to make an exchange  

competitive markets - many different buyers and sellers  
there is not one individual seller monopolizing the market  

## Demand
**demand** - relationship between price of a good or serivce and the quantity that consumers are willing and able to buy at each price level  
demand is the whole price spectrum of a good or service  

**quantity demanded** - the specific amount of a good consumers will purchase at a specific price  

**demand schedule** - a table containing the price and quantity demanded at various prices  
can be turned into a demand graph  
price is the y-axis, and the quantity demanded is the x-axis  

demand curve is almost always downwards sloping  

**law of demand** - when the price of something goes down, people buy more of it; the inverse is true  
there is an inverse relationship between price of a good and quantity demanded  

why?  
holds because of *utility*  
**utility** - the benefit or satisfaction a consumer gets from consuming a good or service  

at a high price, consumer may perceive that the cost outweighs the benefit (utility) they recieve from the good  
thus, the consumer will be less willing to purchase it, leading to a lower quantity demanded  

at a low price, the consumer percieves the product as less of a service, and makes the good more attractive to buy  

as a good is purchased more, the satisfaction is less  

## Market vs Individual Demand  
**individual demand** - demand of a product for a single consumer at various prices  
**market demand** - sum of all the individual demands for a good at all price ranges  
(demand of a single city, nation, etc.)  

**demand is not static** (it is like a snapshot in time)  

## Changes in Demand
when something other than the price of a good changes, it affects how much the demand changes  
a change in demand will cause a new demand curve  

a demand curve shifting to the left means a higher demand; to the right signifies a lower demand

price itself does not change the demand, it only changes the **quantity demanded**
it moves you *along* the demand curve  

Factors that can cause a demand curve to shift (not price, as it moves your position on the curve):  
- number of buyers
- income  
- consumer preferences  
- consumer expectations (how people anticipate future prices and income impacts; e.g. anticipating a sale)  
- price of other products (substitutes and complements; e.g. ketchup and hotdogs)

# Sept. 13, 2024

## Supply Curve
the producers of good and services, and how price affects the quantities they produce  

**supply** - explains the behavious of producers and sellers  
supply is the relationship between the quantity of a good that producersare willing and able to provide

resources and technoogy determine what is possible  
supply reflects a decision about which technologically feasible items to produce  

quantity supplied - amount of goods a producer will make at a given price  
supply - the relationship between price and quantity  

some producers are more efficient, and thus produce their products at a lower **marginal cost** (the cost of making one unit of a product)  
firms with lower costs are willing to sell their products at a lower price  

firms will price the items to the highest price that bring in the most money  

**the law of supply** - there is a direct relationship between the price of a product and the quantity supplied  
if the price of a good increases, firms will increase the quantity supplied (for more profit)  
if the price of a good falls, firms will decrease the quantity supplied (note that demand has an *inverse* relationship)  

producers are willing to supply a good only if they at least cover their marginal cost of production  

**supply schedule** - a table representing how much producers are willing to sell at each price and quantity  

a supply schedule turns into the supply curve (a graph)  

### Vertical Supply Curve
**fixed quantity** - the price increases but there is no time or no possibility of ever producing more (antiques, original paintings, etc.)  

### Supply is not Static 
the supply curve does not represent a permanent relationship between price and production quantities (it is a snapshot in time)  

### Change in quantity supplied  
if price rises/falls, the quantity **supplied** is changed, not the supply  
other variables will change the *entire* supply curve either left (decrease) or right (increase)  

non-price determinants of supply:
- resource prices (raw materials)
- taxes (indirect / tax on profit; taxes are a cost of production)
- subsidies (payments to businesses from the government has the opposite effect of tax)  
- future expectations
- number of firms (as number of factories increase, so does the supply)  
- shocks (unpredictable events; e.g. natural disasters destroying raw materials / factories)
- technology (improving technology makes production more efficient; less waste or production at a cheaper price)  
- price of related goods and services (same productive resources; e.g. planting more wheat in a field than corn if corn is more expensive)  
(butter and skimmed milk are produced with the same resources, a producer will produce the cheaper one more)  

# Sept. 17, 2024

## Substitution and Income effect 
related to demand, and can be used to explain the inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded  

**substitute effect** - when the price of an item decreases, a consumer is more likely to substitute (buy more) of a product  
**income effect** - when a consumer's purchasing power increases, such as when the price of an item falls (the consumer can now
buy more of the same item with the same amount of money), the consumer is more likely to buy more of said product

the inverse is true for both of these effects  
this can be used alongside the **law of diminishing marginal utility**  

# Sept. 19, 2024

moral vs natural philosophy  
moral - events and phenomena in the social world (economics)   
natural - events and phenomena in the natural world  

Adam Smith was the first to try to explain the economy in a systematic way  

## Adam Smith - Father of Economics 
wrote The Wealth of Nations  
mostly borrowed ideas of his time  
tried to explain how an economy can hold itself together and grow  

wanted to explain how an economic system without government control could prosper (was in a time where repressive government were under attack)  
if everyone does the best for oneself -> greatest good for society  

leads to competition  
keeps people's self-interest in check  

the **invisible hand**  
decisions that lead to the self-regulation of the market due to self-interest  

also known as the **laissez faire** economy (free market without government intervention)  

Adam Smith acknowledged the government should provide national defence, security and justice, and public infrastructure  
all this is financed through taxation  

believed competeition would cause monopolies to not arise  

allowed for *specialization* and *absolute advanage*  
absolute advantage - a country should produce that which it can produce the most efficiently  
if all countries traded amongst each other, and used absolute advantage, all would benefit  

## Classical Economics  
concerned with growth of the economy and distribution of income  

**Jeremy Bentham** promoted **utilitarianism**, a philosophy of ethics  
an action is right if it promotes the most happniess for the largest number of people  

**John Stuart Mill** furthered the idea of utilitarianism; the most important factor is happiness  

concerned with what gave products its *value*  
original **labour theory of value** - value comes from the amount of labour put in to cerate the product

two main factors:  
- utility, the pleausre from consuming something  
- the cost of consuming one more unit of the good (**marignal utility**)  

## Say's Law 
in ordinary circumstances, unemployment would not arise for long periods of time as the economy would keep
producing as much as is required to keep workers fully employed  

that being - **supply creates its own demand**  
a firm creating products provides workers enough money to buy products  

when the Great Depression came, general economics split into micro and macroeconomics to explain unemployment (economics was whole at this point)  

## Karl Marx 
based off the *labour theory of value*  
noticed **surplus value**  
surplus value - the excess profit firm owners make based off the price the product was sold and the wages the owners paid to get said product  

believed capitalism was unstable  
firm owners want to maximize profit, and would keep trying to find machines to automate the production process  
would lead to unemployment and poor working conditions  

his insights are still useful today (recurrence of crises, growing job insecurities, unemployment due to rapid techonlogical change)  
had influence on social sciences (sociology, anthropology, political science, etc.)  

## John Maynard Keynes
wages were sticky (meaning difficult to fall), and thus so were prices  
if wages fell, workers would have less to spend  
spending would go down, but prices would not as wages were sticky  
thus, the economic system could not on its own go back to full employment  

argued government would have to intervene by increasing government spending  
building more schools, roads, etc. would help unemployment (concept of a ***multiplier***)  

argued government intervention is needed to avoid prolonged recessions and high unemployment  

lead to the development of macroeconomics  

## Monetarism and New Classical Economics 
Milton Friedman emphasized the role of money in the economy  
change in the money supply affects output in the short-term, and prices levels in the long-term  

Robert Lucas emphasized the importance of individuals and their 'rational expectations' of inflation and government policy (new classical economics)  

these two different principles share a unifying principle - *the role of markets in bringing the economy back to a situation where
there is full employment without any government intervention*  

argued government intervention *causes* sticky prices and wages due to trade unions, minimum wage laws, etc.  
supply and demand would fix the markets on their own and achieve high levels of output and full employment  

rejects Keynesian economics and returns back to laissez-faire, giving the term *new classical*  

## Behavioural Economics 
argues the humand mind works in ways that are not rational  
experiments and evidence are used to create an economic theory, not a theory being created first, then it being used to explain human behaviour
this is then used to create economic policies  

**circular economy** - rather than creating products then throwing them out, we repurpose or repair those items to achieve sustainable development  

## Non-Price Determinants of Demand 
- income in case of normal goods -> if income increases, demand increases 
- income in case of inferior goods -> if income increases, demand decreases 
- preferences -> if preference for an item increases, demand increases 
- substitude goods (coca cola and pepsi) -> if price of good X decreases, demand for good Y decreases 
- complementary goods (computers and computer software) -> if price of good X decreases, demand for Y increases 
- number of consumers -> if consumers of a good increase, the demand for said good increases  

## Non-Price Determinants of Supply 
- cost of factors of production -> if a factor of production (labour, land, capital, etc.) increases in price, supply decreases
- technology -> as technology improves, supply increases as production is more efficient  
- competitive supply (corn and wheat) -> as the price of X decreases, the supply of Y increases (as Y is now more profitable relative to X), 
and vice versa
- joint supply (butter and skimmed milk) -> one can not be produced without the other, as price increases for X, supply for Y increases  
(removing cream from milk to turn into butter makes skimmed milk as a result)
- firm price expectations -> if a firm expects prices to rise, supply decreases 
- taxes -> as taxes increase (a cost of production), supply decreases 
- subsidies -> as subsidies increase, supply increases 
- number of firms -> as number of firms increase (number of producers), supply increases 
- shocks (war, weather, etc.) -> most probably a decrease in supply

# Sept. 20, 2024 - Understand the world through the use of models  

## The Circular Flow Income Model
assume our economy is a closed economy (no international trade)  
income is flowing only around our economy  

demonstrates how income flows around the economy  
the only decision markets are households and firms  
linked through product and resources markets  

firms buy factors of production in the resource markets  
households make up the resource markets  
firms then produce goods, which goes into the product markets  
households then buy from the product markets, giving money back to the firms  

households sell their factors of production to firms, they receive payments (**income of households**) (wages, rent payments, etc.)  
payments that households make to buy goods and services are **household expenditures**   

payments that firms make to buy factors of production are **cost of production** and payments they receive is their **revenue**  

firms -> households -> firms  

## Leakages and Injections
in the real world, there is very few closed economies  
some factors that cause money to leak out of the economy and factors that inject money into the eocnomy  

**Leakages** - non-consumption uses of income that reduce the flow of money in the economy  
**Injections** - money that comes into the economy that stimulate economic activity  

an economy aims to have an equal amount of leaks and injections  
all leakages will eventually be injected back into the economy in some way  

Leakages occur due to:  
- savings -> households do not spend every single penny that they make, the households are not spending all the money that firms pay them  
- taxes -> money is not immediately given back to households  
- imports -> spending on foreign goods and services takes money out of the domestic economy, lowering domestic demand  

all these factors disrupt the circular flow income model  

Injections occur due to:  
- investments -> expenditures by firms on capital goods boost production and create jobs, money and more jobs are entering the economy  
- government spending -> spending on public infrastructure and services stimulates demands in the economy by making us more efficient in 
resource consumption  
- exports -> sales of domestically produced goods and services to foreign buyers brings money into the domestic economy  

## Three pairs of leakges and injections
pairs:
- financial markets
- governments 
- other countries 

### Financial Markets 
households save money they gain, leaking money from the economy  
firms invest in products / capital from their savings, injecting money into the economy  

### Governments
governments tax people and firms, leaking money from the economy  
governments start public projects to build infrastructure and to provide more goods, injecting money into the economy  

### Other Countries
households / firms buy goods from other countries, leaking money from the economy  
other countries purchase domestic goods, increasing demand and injecting money into the domestic economy  

# Sept. 23, 2024 

as price increases, suppliers will supply more  
price is an **incentive** for suppliers  

## Factors increasing supply 
- cost of production decreases  
- techonlogy improves  
- sellers expected good things in the future  
- more sellers enter the market  
- opportunities in different markets are bad  
- favourable natural events  

## Factors decreasing supply  
- cost of production increases  
- technology becomes outdated  
- sellers expect bad things in the future  
- sellers leave the market 
- opportunities in other markets are good  
- unfavourable natural events 

increase in supply -> price goes down   
decrease in supply -> price goes up  
*supply, not quantity supplied*  

## Theory of the Firm 
analyzes how businesses make decisions regarding production, pricing, and resource allocation to maximize profits  
assumes all businesses are trying to maximize profits  
*invisible hand* comes into play here  

**shows the relationship between revenue, costs, and profits**  

revenue depends on price charges and the quantity sold at that price  

costs depend on **fixed costs** and **variable costs**  
fixed costs - remain the same at all levels of production (rent)  
variable costs - change with the level of production (labour / wages, utility bills, etc.)  

**total profit / revenue = (price * quantity sold) - (variable + fixed costs)**

## Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns  
all firms use inputs (resources, factors of production) to produce outputs  

short run vs long run (time periods)  

**short run** - costs of resources and inputs are relatively flexible, and can be adjusted quickly  
maximum capacity is *fixed* because of a shortage of at least one resource (a **limiting factor**, normally a factor or production or a fixed cost)    
thus, the ability to produce is limited  

Ex: a factory can increase production by running machinery longer or adding shifts, but it cannot buy new machines immediately
due to fixed capital costs

factories are a fixed, capital resource that can not quickly be adjusted (it is a *fixed cost*)  

**long run** - all costs are variable (nothing is fixed)  
costs and resources can all be adjusted  
factors of production can be adjusted  

Ex: a manufacturing company may build a new facility to increase 
production capacity after analyzing long-term market trends.  

## Diminishing Returns 
firms have both fixed and variable inputs  
**marginal product** - refers to the additional output generated by adding one more unit of a specific input, while keeping other inputs constant  

- total product -> total quantity of output  
- marginal product -> extra or additional output produced by adding one additional variable (1 more labourer)  
- total cost -> all costs of production incurred by a firm  
- marginal cost -> the extra cost of producing one more unit of *output*  

## Law of Diminishing Returns / Law of Diminishing Marginal Products  
as more units of variable inputs (labour) are added to fixed inputs (land), the marginal product of the variable input will 
at first input, but eventually, there will be a point where the marginal product will begin to fall  

in case of workers, a possible explanation is that there simply is not enough work to do for the new unit of variable input (new labourer) to 
be put to 100% efficiency  

marginal product (MP) decreases as variable inputs increase so long as other inputs remain constant  

Ex: if there are 8 workers and 6 machines, any additional workers (increases in variable inputs) will have a marginal product (MP) of 0  

# Sept. 25, 2024 

## Market Equilibrium
the buyer must agree to buy at a price, and the seller to sell the product at the same price  
they must agree for the transaction to occur  

**market equilibrium** - when buyers and sellers agree to a price  

the *invisible hand* guides the market  
the market will eventually balance itself out, the buyers and sellers will come to an agreement in a competitive market  

equilibrium is a situation in which opposing forces balance each other.  
**equilibrium price** - quantity demanded == quantity supplied  
**equilibrium quantity** - the quantity bought and sold at the equilibrium price (where supply and demand intersect)  

## Surplus 
at higher prices, a surplus occurs  
suppliers will want to produce more than buyers will consume  

the suppliers want to profit at the higher price, and thus will produce more  
however, the consumer is not willing to purchase that product at that price (at least not at the quantity that is being supplied)  

## Shortage
at low prices, buyers are willing to buy more than suppliers are willing to supply  

suppliers do not want to produce / supply this product as they are making less of a profit  

## PPC
as wants and needs changes, the production point on the PPC moves  
the interaction between buyers and suppliers move where the society is on the PPC  

at equilibrium, the buyers and sellers' choices are satisfied and in balance  
this is the **market mechanism**, known as the *invisible hand*  

firms that produce product determine how they will produce products based off what resources and technologies are available to them  

## Price Signals and Incentives
as signals prices communicate info to the decision makers  
as incentives prices motivate decision makers to respond to the information  

is it possible for market equilibrium to not be achieved (be in surplus or shortage)?  
in the short term, *yes*, that is possible due to constant fluctuations  

surplus -> equilibrium, buyers will buy less  
shortage -> equilibrium, sellers will produce more  

## Surplus to Equilibrium
as surplus builds up, producers will be left with too much good that can not be sold - **surplus inventory**  
suppliers will then drive the price down to get rid of the product  

## Price Adjustments
prices below equilibrium -> a shortage forces the price to go up  
prices above the equilibrium -> a surplus forces prices to go down  

## Shortage to Equilibrium
prices are too low  
suppliers see a chance to make a profit, and raise the price of the product  
hope to deter some consumers from buying the product  
the supply can not currently meet the demand  

**supply and demand will often change due to a changing economic climate**  

as price goes up, the demand decrease, and producers will produce more -> equilibrium  

## Changes in Demand 
an increase in demand shifts the demand curve to the right  
this also shifts the equilibrium price  
looking at the original equilibrium, there is now a shortage (prices will go up to reach equilibrium)  

## Changes in Supply 
if supply shifts to the right, a surplus at the original price will occur  
prices will fall, and thus quantity demanded will increase  

## Double Shifts
when both curves shift, either the price or the quantity will be indeterminate

**signals** tells economic agents make decisions by conveying the current state of the market or economy  
**incentives** are something that motivates individuals or firms to behave in a particular way by altering the costs and benefits
associated with a choice  

**rationing** - a way of distributing or allocating goods and services among consumers or households  
pricing rationing - those that are willing and able to pay the price at that price will recieve the good / service  
non-price rationing - first come first serve  

**efficiency** - making the best use of resources  
**allocative efficiency** - producing the combination of goods most wanted by society  
**productive efficiency** - producing goods using the fewest possible resources, at the lowest cost  

**economic efficiency** - efficient producers must produce the right combination of resources for the economy  

## Consumer surplus
the highest price to pay for a good minus the price actually paid  
area between demand curve and equilibrium price  

## Producer surplus
the price received for selling their good inus the lowest price they are willing to accept to produce that good  
the lowest price a firm is willing to accept represents the cost of producing an extra unit of the good (marginal cost)  

## Competitive Market Equilibrium  
the sum of the consumer and producer surplus is known as a **social or community surplus**  
this value is maximized at market equilibrium  

market equilibrium is when marginal benefit (demand curve) = marginal cost (supply curve)  
social surplus is maximized  
allocative efficiency is achieved  
social welfare is also maximized (well-being of society)  

P intercept - the point on the P axis that is met by a curve  
Q intercept - the point on the Q axis that is met by a curve  

## Formulas
**consumer surplus** = ((P intercept of demand curve - equilibrium price) \* equilibrium quantity) / 2  
**producer surplus** = ((equilibrium price - P intercept of supply curve) \* equilibrium quantity) / 2  
social surplus = consumer surplus + producer surplus  

## Area of Trapezium
there may not always be a P intercept  

A = ((a + b) \* c) / 2 (area of trapezoid)  

## Government Intervention
**when looking at market efficiency, there should be no government intervention**  
efficiency is only possible in highly unrealistic conditions  
market failrues are an important justification for government intervention  

competitive markets can not sufficiently answer *whom* to produce for  

# Oct. 1, 2024

economic theories are based of the assumption of **rational economic decision-making**  
individuals aim to maximize ssatisfaction  

## Rational Consumer Choice
consumers make decisions according to their tastes  
3 assumptions:  
- consumer is able to rank goods according to preference (*completeness* assumption)  
- preferences among alternative choices are consistent (*transitivity* assumption)  
- consumer prefers more than less (*non-satiation* assumption)  

assumes consumers have **perfect information** (sees the full picture about altneratives)  
assumes consumers will try to maximize their *utility*  

## Behavioural Economics
criticizes consumer rationality and utility maximization  

### Biases
**bias (cognitive bias)** - systematic errors in thinking or evaluating  

types of biases:  

#### Rules of thumb
simplifies consumer choices rather than making complicated decisions  

1 cup of coffee has 80mg of caffeine, etc.  

#### Anchoring
using irrelevant information to make decisions, most often due to it being the first piece of information seen  

buying pants at $100 after seeing another pair at $150 thinking its a bargain, when a pair could have been bought at $50  

#### Framing
deals with how choices are presented to the consumer  

80% lean beef vs 20% fat beef  
faded jeans at a boutique store vs at a discount store  

#### Availability
people tend to rely on information that is more readily available, partly due to people remembering recents events and information 
more than past events and information  

after seeing advertisements on the superiority of brand 2, a consumer may be more likely to select brand 2 than brand 1  

biases lead to the belief there is a more accurate way to describe consumer behaviour:  

### Bounded Rationality
consumers are rational within limits, maximizing utility is a costly process  
rationality is limited by a consumer's information, the costliness to obtain information, and the ability to process large amounts of information  

consumers seek **satisfice** (seeking a satisfactory outcome over the optimal outcome)  

### Bounded Self-Control
people do not have the self-control to always make rational decisions

### Bounded Selfishness
people are only selfish within limits  
people do not always act in their best self-interest  

### Imperfect Information
consumers do not have access to complete information on prices, products, quality, etc.  
thus, it is impossible to maximize utility, as *perfect knowledge* was an initial assumption  

behavioural economics is not based on assumptions on human behaviour, rather experiments that try to observe how people behave and react  

### Nudge Theory
**nudge** - a method designed to influence consumers' choices in a predictable way, without offering
financial incentives or imposing sanctions, and without limiting choice  

Ex:  
in the United Kingdoms, tax payments of late taxpayers increased by 15% when told most people in their area had already paid their taxes  

behavioural economics has been more successful in finance  

### Choice Architecture
based on the idea that consumers are influcned by how options are presented to them  

**framing** is an important part of choice architecture  
framing defines the context in which choices are presented to decision-makers  

different types of choices:  

#### Default Choice
choice made when the consumers does not do anything  
made by habit or lack of interest in taking a deliberate action  

#### Restricted Choice
choice that is limited by the government or other authority  

Ex:  
speed limits, voting age, etc.  

argued that people have too many choices available, and not enough information to make good choices  
choice architecture can take advantage of restrictions to encourage people to make choices with socially desirable outcomes  

#### Mandated Choice
choice between altneratives that is compulsory by the government or authority (a required choice)  
it is a free choice, but is is mandatory to make that free choice  

nudges often affects consumers on a sub-conscious level; it is manipulative  

choice architecture takes advantage of the incomplete information available to the consumer, and 
selectively provides information (such as through framing) to encourage consumers to act in a particular way  
thus, it is argued that there should be transparency and open discussion of nudges used for economic policy  

### Evaluating Behaviour Economics
advantages:  
- simple and low-cost way to influence people's behaviour to act in socially desireable ways  
- has shown success, implying choice architecture and nudging have numerous possible applications in areas that are yet unexplored  
- offers consumers and citizens freedom of choice without restricting or forcing them to do anything  
- may overcome the theory of consumer behaviour, due to the irrationality of actual consumer behaviour  
- policies are based on psychology, which have been tested over many years  
- policies are developed through trials, allowing for trial-and-error methods to achieve desired results  

disadvantages:  
- it is not based on any understanding of human behaviour, and thus can not lead to a systematic and unifying theory on human
behaviour with general applicability
- the unsystematic approach may not be valid over time or across different income groups, social groups, or cultures -> reduces
applicability of policies being devloped over time and in different people groups
- using psychological principles to manipulate consumers to act in ways not necessarily in their best interests  
- behavioural policies may be used as substitutes to necessary but politically costly economic policies, such as taxes on
socially harmful goods
- traditional economic policies may be more effective
- could be a new form of government regulation camouflaged under the guise of freedom and choice -> more dangerous than conventional
government control as people may not be aware of its existence and its effects on their choices
- choice architecture and nudging may affect people's choices, but these choices may not be a reflection of their true preferences

## Firm Business Objectives
standard economic theory of the firm assumes **rational producer behaviour**  
firms want to maximize profit  

profit maximization involves determing the level of output to produce the maximum profit  

profit = revenue - cost  

profit maximization may not always be the overriding objective of firms  

self-interested behaviour of firms often leads to negative consequences for society  
Ex:  
underpaying child labour, polluting the environment, etc.  

however, these consequences can lead to a negative image by society, lowering profits, or lead to government regulation, also lowering profits  
thus, firms must display **corporate social responsibility**, such as:  
- avoiding polluting activities  
- supporting human rights, such as avoiding child labour and investing in countries with politically oppressive regimes  
- art and athletics sponsorships  
- donations to charities  

whilst ethical behaviour may lower costs and increase expected profits, unethical behaviour may lead to boycotts
and customer avoidance, lowering total profits  

studies that try to measure how behaviouru correlates to profits have been inconclusive, but majority of firms do not want to take this risk  

### Market Share 
percentage of total sales in a market that is earned by a single firm  
high market share indicates popularity amongst buyers  

implies a high **economies of scale**, allowing firms to increase its profitability  

market share is important as it allows comparisons of how well a firm is doing to its competitors  

maintaining market share -> growing at the same rate as overall market  
growing market share -> doing well in comparison to competitors  
falling market share -> not doing as well in competitors in terms of sales of its products  

firms may try to lower its prices, introduce new or innovative products into the market, or use advertising to increase market share  
each carry a risk of lowering profits  
lowered profits may be acceptable if the firm remains profitable and continues to earn a satisfactory level of profits  

### Growth Maximization
another possible objective instead of maximizing profits  

why?  
- growing firm can achieve economies of scale and lower its average costs  
- can diversify production of different products and markets and reduce its dependence on a single product or market  
- greater market power and increased ability fo influence prices, again potentially increasing its profitability  
- reduces its risks as it is less affect in a economic downturn (recession) and less likely to be taken over (bought) by another firm  
- reconciles interests of both owners and managers (profit maximization favours owners whereas revenue maximization favours managers)  

### Revenue Maximization
firm managers may be more interseted in maximizing revenue and sales rather than profit  
this is due to:  
- sales can be identified and measured more easily than profits in the short term, whcih can be used to motivate employees  
- rewards for managers and employees are often linked to increased sales rather than increased profits  
- it is often assumed revenue from more sales will increase more rapidly than cost, causing profit to also increase  
- increased sales give rise to feelings of success, whereas decreased sales create feelings of failure  

### Satisficing 
a firm will typically not only try to maximize one goal (profits, market share, etc.)  
rather, a firm is composed of separate groups, each with its own objectives that may overlap or conflict  

prevents a firm from pursuing any kind of maximizing behaviour  
firms thus establish processes where they can compromise, which results in the pursuit of many objectives that are placed in a hierarchy  
this behaviour is known as **satisficing**  

**satisficing** - firms try to achieve a satisfactory level of profits together with satisfactory results for many 
more objectives, rather than the optimal or 'best' results for any one objective  
Ex:  
a firm does not solely maximize profits but also growth and revenue as well  

# Oct. 2, 2024 - Elasticity

elasticity of demand and supply  

## Elasticity of Demand
**elastic** - how much something can stretch or change in response to another variable  

**Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)** - the measure of change in quantity demanded and the change in its price  
PED is calculated *along* the demand curve  

price inelastic - a change in price causes a smaller % change in demand  
price elastic - a change in price causes a bigger % change in demand  

### Elastic Goods
goods with very elastic demand tend to be non-necessary goods (designer shoes, luxury handbags, etc.)  

### Inelastic Goods
goods with **no easy substitutes** (insulin, gasoline, etc.)  
**when price increases, demand stays relatively steady**  
there are no other options, consumers need to buy the same amount  

an increase in price would ahve less of an effect on the consumption of staple foods than it would have on luxury foods (rice vs apple pie)  

### Why PED Matters
it is important to understand price elasticity to know how the relationship between the price of a good influence its demand  
if the quantity demanded changes a lot when prices changes a little, a product is said to be *elastic*  
when there is a small change in quantity demanded when prices changes a lot, a product is said to be *inelastic*  

PED = percentage change in quantity demanded / percentage change in price  

price elasticity is usually **negative**  
it is a common practice to use the **absolute value** instead  
done to avoid confusion when making comparisons between different values of PED  

the final value is the **coefficient of elasticity**  

results:  
- PED = 0 -> consumers pay no attention to price (insulin); represented by a **veritcal line**  
- 0 < PED < 1 -> inelastic price; consumers are not *too* sensitive to price (gasoline)  
- PED = 1 -> (**unit elastic**) demand is neither elastic nor inelastic; prices change by x%, quantity demanded changes by x%  
- PED > 1 -> elastic demand; consumers are *very* sensitive to changes in prcie (luxury items)  
- PED is infinite -> consumers will not buy the product if the price changes *slightly*; represented by a **horizontal line**  

elastic / inelastic should only be used to refer to a portion of a demand curve  
elasticity changes along the position of the demand curve  

### Determinants of PED
S: available substitutes -> more elastic  
P: proportion of income spent -> more elastic 
L: luxuries and necessities -> necessities are inelastic  
A: habit forming or addictive -> inelastic  
T: time to adjust / length of time -> over time, goods become more elastic, as it becomes easier to buy **other** goods (substitutes)  

can not be compared based on the slope of the curve, the calculations must be done due to different scales  
PED's can only be compared if they intersect at some point  

### Total Revenue
each section of the demand curve has a different PED  
**total revenue** - price \* quantity (at a certain point on the demand curve)  

inelastic - total revenue moved in same direction as the price  
elastic - total revenue moved in the opposite direction as price  
unit elastic - total revenue did not change  

**profit** = total revenue - total cost  
a firm aims to maximize *profit* not revenue  
as revenue rises, cost may rise faster  

## Primary Commodities vs Manufactured Products  
**primary commodities** - goods arising directly from the use of natural resources; normally inelastic (foods and oils)  
**manufactured products** - goods produced by labour usually working together with capital and raw materials; more elastic
as there are substitutes (computers and cars)  

# Oct. 3, 2024

## Income Elasticity of Demand (YED)  
measures how the quantity demanded of a good or service changes in response to a chnage in consumer income  
used to determine if a good is a normal or inferior good  

provides info of demand given a change in income and the size of the change  

**YED** = % change in quantity demanded / % change in income  

YED can be both positive and negative  
positive number -> normal good at that income level (income increases, demand increases)  
negative number -> inferior good at that income level  

types of positive YED:
- 0 < YED < 1 -> income inelastic demand (necessities)  
- YED > 1 -> normal goods that are **luxuries** (income elastic demand)  
- YED < 0 -> inferior good, demand and income are inversely proportional (ex: taking the bus, second-hand clothes, etc.)  

YED < 1 (necessities):    
a percentange increase in income has a smaller percentage increase in quantity demanded  
income **inelastic** demand  

YED > 1 (luxuries):  
income **elastic** demand  
a percentage increase in income = a larger percentage increase in quantity demanded  
the percentage of income spent on these items *increases faster* than income  

more travel, luxury cars, etc.  

### Engel Curve
a good turns from a normal good to an inferior good  
for normal goods, the slope is positive  
for inferior goods, the slop is negative  
at YED = 0, the slops is undefined  

### YED Implications for Producers and the Economy
as countries experience economic growth, goods with an income elastic demand will grow  
if society's income has grown by 3%, income spent on travel may be 4%  

for necessities (income inelastic demand), such as clothes and foods, growth may be at 2%  

the higher then YED for a good or service, the greater the expansion in the market  
the lower the YED, the smaller the expansion  

producers interested in producing in an expanding market may want to know their product's YED  

in a recession, luxuries are hit the hardest, whereas necessities (with low YEDs), have a smaller drop in sales  

### Economic Sectors
primary sector - primary products  
manufacturing sectors - cars  
services sectors - travel, banking, insurance  

as the economy grows, the size of these 3 sectors will grow in different ways  

agricultural products grow slowly than the growth in income (YED < 1)  
manufactured goods grow faster than economic growth (YED > 1)  

synthetic goods have a higher percentage of income spent on them as income rises (YED > 1)  

many services have a higher YED, so the percentage demand for these is much larger  

economies in less developed countries usually have a large primary sector due to the important of agriculture,
while manufactured goods or services are less important  

# Oct. 4, 2024

## Price Elasticity of Supply
measures how much the quantity supplied of a good responds to a change in its price  

**elasticity of supply** = % change in quantity supplied / % change in price  

PES < 1 - inelastic supply  
quantity supplied does not change much when price changes  
difficult and expensive to increase production  

Ex: supply of gold  

PES > 1 - elastic supply  
large response in the change in quantity supplied when price rises  
easy and inexpensive to increase production  

Ex: snow-shoveling services  

PES = 0 - perfectly inelastic supply  
quantity supplied does not respond to change in price (antiques)  

PES = infinity - perfectly elastic supply  
producers are willing to supply an unlimited good at a price but nothing below that price  

PES = 1 - unit elastic supply  
percentage quantity supplied is identical to percentage change in price  

Ex:  
price increases by 10% -> quantity supplied will also increase by 10%  

### Factors Influencing Elasticy of Supply 
- availability of additional resources -> the more resources, the more elastic  
- mobility of resources -> the easier to shift resources, the more elastic  
- spare (unused) capacity of firms -> the more idle equipment, the more elasitc  
- ability to store stock -> the more that can be stored, the more elastic  
- time production takes -> the shorter the time produciton takes, the more elastic  
- rate at which costs increase -> the slower the rate at which costs increase, the more elastic  

# Oct. 23, 2024 - Government Intervention

## Why Do Governments Intervene?
- earn revenue (indirect taxes)
- provide support to firms (subsidies)
- support households with low incomes
- influence production level of firms 
- influence consumption of households and consumers (**merit vs. demerit goods**)
- correct market failure (allocative efficiency)
- promote *equity* in the market system 

## How Do Governments Intervene?
- price controls (**price ceilings and price floors**)
- indirect taxes 
- subsidies
- direct provision of services 
- command and control regulation and legislation 
- consumer nudge 

## Price Controls
**price controls** - the minimum or maximum price set by the government (or private organizations) so that prices are 
*unable* to adjust to equilibrium levels as determined by supply and demand  

**market-clearing price** - a price where there is no shortages or surplus (Qd = Qs)  
market disequilibrium causes this  

## Price Ceilings
the government establishes a **legal maximum price**  
the legal price charged by sellers can not be higher than the legal maximum price  

### Benefits
- price falls, making the good more **affordable**  
- slows inflation, when prices rise much faster than wages in society

### Consequences
- underallocation of resources to the good (allocative inefficiency)
- shortages (price set is under the equilibrium, thus goods are "too easy" to get)
- non-price rationing 
- underground / parallel markets 
- negative welfare impacts (shortages, reduced quality, black markets -> make the consumer / producer experience worse)

Ex: rent control  
max price on rent set by government, demand rises, tenants illegally charge more (black market)  

### Consequences for the Economy and Stakeholders
refer to slideshow

consumers able to buy at the lower price are better off, but some are unsatisfied as there is not enough of the good to satisfy demand  
producers are worse off as they are now selling a smaller quantity at a lower price, lowering revenue (loss of producer surplus)
some workers are fired due to less output, workers are worse off  
government does not gain or lose money, but main gain popularity amongst those consumers who benefited  

### Calculating Effects Of Price Ceilings
**expenditure** - how much money is spent  
change is always calculated as **final - initial**  

welfare loss is given by the area of triangles **b + d** (refer to physical notes)  

derive all formulas using triangle and trapezoid area formulas, or refer to physical notes  
A (triangle) = (bh) / 2  
A (trapezoid / trapezium) = h/2 \* (b1 + b2)  

# Oct. 24, 2024

## Price Floors
**price floor** - a legal minimum price usually set above the equilibrium price; prevents prices from being too low  

benefits producers by allowing them to make more profits  
benefits workers, in the case of minimum wage  

Ex:  
alcohol has a price floor to minimize over consumption  

Pros:  
- businesses make more money and get higher profit margins
- for minimum wage, workers get more money  

Cons:  
- businesses may overproduce (surplus)  
- government may have to buy this surplus and dispose of it off the market (agriculture)  
- for minimum wage, workers may have a tough time finding work (finding a job is higher in demand)  
may lead to a black market for employment  

farmer incomes are often unstable or too low in some countries  
government may add a price floor above the equilibrium price, known as **price supports**  

### How do Governments Dispose of Surpluses?
- store it (but will raise prices due to storage costs)
- sell abroad (but lower the price as those abroad may not want to buy it at such a high price -> government will lose money)
- aid developing countries (no benefit)  

governments do not benefit when getting rid of surpluses  

### Consequences for the Economy
negative welfare impacts  
producer surplus increases, but consumer surplus decreases  

consumers - worse off, higher price for goods  
producers - better off, higher price and produces more since the government buys their surplus  
workers - better off, employment increases due to the great production of goods  
government - worse off, has to purchase excess supply  
other countries - worse off, misallocation of resources  

# Oct. 28, 2024 - Minimum Wage

minimum wage is a variation of a floor price  
how does this affect the labour force?  

many countries have minimum wage laws  

guarantees an adequate income for low income, low skilled workers  
aims to provide workers with a livable wage  

is set **above** the equilibrium wage to ensure workers earn enough to meet basic living standards  

## Impact of Minimum Wages on Markets
Supply and Demand:  
D = the quantity of labour firms are willing and able to hire  
S = the quantity of labour that workers supply at each wage  

## Consequences on the Economy 
causes a labour surplus and unemployment  
more people want to work at the minimum wage than there are jobs available (workers are more enticed)  

firms hire less as hiring becomes more expensive  
firms rather higher less workers with more skills (which may cost more than minimum wage) to complete a task  

- illegal immigrants may immigrate and get paid below minimum wage
- misallocation of labour resources - low skilled workers are hired less (higher-skilled workers are hired more instead as they contribute 
more to the firmś output)  
- misallocation in product markets - increased cost in labour can disrupt the production of pricing of products
(less unskilled workers = less production)  

### Welfare Impacts  
the area between market equilibrium and quantity demanded is lost  

### Stakeholder Impacts 
- firms - worse off, higher costs of production 
- workers - gain / lose (some gain higher wages from their employers even if they are above minimum wage, but some workers lose due to higher
unemployment)  
- consumers - worse off, increased price of labour = decreased supply of products = higher price of products available
