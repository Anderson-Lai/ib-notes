# Feb. 4, 2025 - Significant Figures

when taking a measurement, the number contains all the certain digits of the measurement + one more figure that is guessed, the **uncertain** digit  
this is used **in place of** +/- like in chemistry  

exponent of the scientific notation does not count towards significant figures  

# Feb. 5, 2025 - Introduction to Kinematics

types of quantities:  
**scalar** - specified by a value (**magnitude**) only; no direction (e.g. mass, time, distance, energy)  
**vector** - specificed by **magnitude** and **direction** (e.g. position, velocity, weight)  

vector notation has arrow on top of variable name  
also has a square brackets beside it indicating the **direction**  

when stating position X is relative to position Y the answer **must** have a **direction** (e.g. 5 metres east)  

**displacement** - measures change in **position**  

**distance** is a **scalar** quantity  

**position** - distance and direction of an object with respect to (w.r.t) a reference point; 
no motion is needed to state position => **vector quantity**  
positio is denoted by the letter **d** (with an arrow on top)  

**displacement** - a change in position, regardless of how it got there; motion is necessary; has magnitude and direction => **vector quantity**  

both position and displacement **have a point of reference**  

distance is a measure of the interval between two locations along the actual path  
as such, distance is **never negative**  

displacement is the measure of the interval between two locations along the **shortest path** connecting them  
displacement **can** be negative as there is a **point of reference**  

Δd = d\_f - d\_i  
(assume there are arrows on top of each *d*)  

## Speed vs Velocity
**speed** = total distance / total time  
**velocity** = total **displacement** / total time  

veloctiy is a **vector quantity** => arrow over variable  

## Interpreting Negatives
by convention:  
- north and east are positive; south and west are negative  
- up and right are positive; down and left are negative  

however, which direction is positive or negative can be defined by using a **frame of reference**  

cartesian coordinate system is used when dealing with vectors  

## Reading d-t Graph
**slope** of the line gives the relative speed / velocity  

**straight line** - uniform / constant speed  
**curved line** - non-uniform speed / acceleration  

**acceleration** - the rate at which an object changes in **speed or velocity w.r.t time**  

## Instantaneous Velocity
derivative of position  
slope of the **tangent line**  

## Average Velocity 
slope of the **secant line**

## Velocity-Time Graphs
to determine if an object is accelerating, take the **absolute value of the mangitude**  
negative sign only gives the **direction** as velocity is a vector quantity  
|v(t)|  

the object is at **rest at the zeroes of the function**  
v(t) = 0

the total displacement is the **area under the curve** for the given interval of time  
∫t1,t2 v(t) dt

average velocity is the **area under the curve for the total time period / total time**  
∫t1,t2 v(t) dt / (t2 - t1)  

## Acceleration
acceleration = Δv / Δt (acceleration has an arrow over it as it is a **vector quantity**)  
**note: d/dt p(t) = v(t); d/dt v(t) = a(t)**  

**decelerate does not mean negative acceleration, just a reduction in velocity**

for a v-t graph, area under the curve = displacement  
remember to have curved lines for constant velocity
