# Feb. 4, 2025 - Significant Figures

when taking a measurement, the number contains all the certain digits of the measurement + one more figure that is guessed, the **uncertain** digit  
this is used **in place of** +/- like in chemistry  

exponent of the scientific notation does not count towards significant figures  

# Feb. 5, 2025 - Introduction to Kinematics

types of quantities:  
**scalar** - specified by a value (**magnitude**) only; no direction (e.g. mass, time, distance, energy)  
**vector** - specificed by **magnitude** and **direction** (e.g. position, velocity, weight)  

vector notation has arrow on top of variable name  
also has a square brackets beside it indicating the **direction**  

when stating position X is relative to position Y the answer **must** have a **direction** (e.g. 5 metres east)  

**displacement** - measures change in **position**  

**distance** is a **scalar** quantity  

**position** - distance and direction of an object with respect to (w.r.t) a reference point; 
no motion is needed to state position => **vector quantity**  
positio is denoted by the letter **d** (with an arrow on top)  

**displacement** - a change in position, regardless of how it got there; motion is necessary; has magnitude and direction => **vector quantity**  

both position and displacement **have a point of reference**  

distance is a measure of the interval between two locations along the actual path  
as such, distance is **never negative**  

displacement is the measure of the interval between two locations along the **shortest path** connecting them  
displacement **can** be negative as there is a **point of reference**  

Δd = d\_f - d\_i  
(assume there are arrows on top of each *d*)  

## Speed vs Velocity
**speed** = total distance / total time  
**velocity** = total **displacement** / total time  

veloctiy is a **vector quantity** => arrow over variable  

## Interpreting Negatives
by convention:  
- north and east are positive; south and west are negative  
- up and right are positive; down and left are negative  

however, which direction is positive or negative can be defined by using a **frame of reference**  

cartesian coordinate system is used when dealing with vectors  

## Reading d-t Graph
**slope** of the line gives the relative speed / velocity  

**straight line** - uniform / constant speed  
**curved line** - non-uniform speed / acceleration  

**acceleration** - the rate at which an object changes in **speed or velocity w.r.t time**  

## Instantaneous Velocity
derivative of position  
slope of the **tangent line**  

## Average Velocity 
slope of the **secant line**  

# Feb. 6, 2025

## Velocity-Time Graphs
to determine if an object is accelerating, take the **absolute value of the magnitude**  
negative sign only gives the **direction** as velocity is a vector quantity  
|v(t)|  

the object is at **rest at the zeroes of the function**  
v(t) = 0

the total displacement is the **area under the curve** for the given interval of time  
∫t1,t2 v(t) dt

average velocity is the **area under the curve for the total time period / total time**  
∫t1,t2 v(t) dt / (t2 - t1)  

## Acceleration
acceleration = Δv / Δt (acceleration has an arrow over it as it is a **vector quantity**)  
**note: d/dt p(t) = v(t); d/dt v(t) = a(t)**  

**decelerate does not mean negative acceleration, just a reduction in velocity**  

# Feb. 10, 2025

for a v-t graph, area under the curve = displacement  
remember to have curved lines for constant velocity  

# Feb. 18, 2025

when objects are in free fall, only **gravity** acts on the object (ignore air resistance)  
all objects experience approximately the same acceleration due to gravity  

common example of **constant acceleration** => all 5 kinematic equations can be used  

**g = -9.80 m/s^2**  
note the negative sign  
or **9.8 m/s^2 [d]**  

# Feb. 21, 2025 - Motion In 2D

when given a direction say [N 30° E], it means start at **north and turn a heading of 30° to east**  

ex: [N 50° W] = final heading of 310°  

to add two vectors graphically, add the two magnitudes together  
then connect the **tail of the first vector to the tip of the second vector**  

the final vector is between those two points with a magnitude of the two magnitudes added together  

the **negative of a vector** is a vector with the same magnitude but points in the opposite direction  
therefore, v2 - v1 is the same as v2 + (-v1)  

# Feb. 24, 2025 - Algebraic Approach To Vectors

a vector can be broken down to a **x and y component**  

calculate the x component and y component of each vector using sine/cosine  

add up the different components in each vector  
use the pythagorean theorem on the summed components to calculate the **magnitude** of the final vector  

with the summed components, tangent can be used to find the **direction of the vector**  

ensure the final answer is positive  
ensure the direction is correct  

# Feb. 25, 2025 - Projectile Motion (Pt. 1)

any **object** given an **initial thrust** and then alowed to **soar through the air** under the influence
of **gravity only** is called a **projectile**  

after the projectile is launched, only gravity is acting on it => all objects accelerates downward at 9.8 m/s^2  
there is **no horizontal acceleration** (a\_x = 0; a\_y = -9.8 m/s^2)  
as such, **v1 = v2**  

air resistance *does* have an effect, but it is too complex to calculate, and thus will be ignored  

**horizontal and vertical motion** are analyzed **separately** as they are **independent**  

angle of the projectile's launch affects the **range (horizontal displacement)**  

# Feb. 26, 2025 - Projectile Motion

if the object lands at the same height it was thrown, Δd\_y = 0  
max height is when v\_y = 0  

**always draw a frame of reference, even if there is no diagram**  

example of final velocity:  
42 m/s [R 32° D]  

use **time** to relate the y component and x component of the projectile  

# Mar. 4, 2025 - Dynamics / Forces

**force** - anything that causes an object to change in **velocity**, i.e., **accelerate**  
**not** required to keep an object moving  

a force is a **push or a pull**  
two types of forces:  
- contact forces - arise from physical contact  
- action-at-a-distance forces - do not require contact  
ex: gravity, electrical forces, magnetic forces  

force is a **vector quantity**  
measured in **newtons (N)**  
force is measured with a **newton's spring scale**  

most common types of forces:  
- applied force (F\_a) - one object contacts another object and **pushes/pulls** on the object  
- tension force (F\_t) - pulling force from a rope or string on an object that **always points toward the rope or string**  
- normal force (F\_n *or* W) - a **perpendicular** force exerted by a **surface** on an object that is in contact with the surface  
always points **away from the surface** (keeps you from falling through the floor)  
- force of friction (F\_fr) - a force that opposes the sliding of two surfaces across one another  
is always **parallel to the surface**; is always the **opposite direction of the object's motion**  
- force of gravity (F\_g) - the force of **attraction between *all* objects**  
force of gravity between Earth and objects at/near the Earth's surface is directed **toward the Earth's surface**  
is an example of an *action-at-a-distance* force => contact is not needed  
force of gravity is **proportional to mass**  

F\_g = m \* g  
m = mass  
g = acceleration due to gravity  

**mass** - the measure of the amount of matter ("stuff") contained in an object  
mass **always remains constant**  

however, **weight** is *not* constant  
it is dependant on the gravitional pull of the planet  

whenever a spring is compressed / extended
a spring will develop a tension force inside the spring that will bring the length **back to its original value**  

**drag forces** - similar to friction forces; opposes acceleration  
ex: air resistance  

**upthrust force** - any object in a fluid experiences this force  
caused by the **pressure the fluid exerts on the body**  
if upthrust = weight => object will float  

## Free Body Diagrams
used to show **all** forces acting on an object  
include a frame of references  
all forces point **away** from the object  
only include forces acting **directly on** the object  
**not** drawn to scale  

to keep an object at a **constant velocity**, there **must** be an applied force (F\_a) in order to oppose **friction / drag forces**  

**net force** (F\_net) - vector sum of all the forces acting on an object  
separate the **horizontal and veritcal directions**  

when F\_net = 0, the object is said to be in **translational equilibrium**  
ex: the object is at rest or the object is at a constant velocity (F\_a = F\_fr + F\_d)  

# Mar. 6, 2025 - Newton's Laws

**inertia** - the property of matter that causes a body to **resist a change** in its state of motion  
**mass is proportional to inertia**  

**first law of motion** - if the net external force on an object is zero, the object will remain at rest or continue to move at a constant velocity  

**net force being 0 leads to a object staying at rest or at a constant velocity**  

**second law of motion** - an **unbalanced** force acting on an object causes the object to **accelerate**  
F\_net = ma  

# Mar. 18, 2025 - Newton's Third Law

for every **action force** there is an equal and opposite **reaction force**  
**forces always act in pairs on *different objects***  

normal force and gravity are *not* an example of newton's third law  

# Mar. 20, 2025 - Elevator Problems

when calculating the **apparent weight** of someone on a scale in an elevator, find the normal force acting on the person  
by newton's third law, there is an equal and opposite reaction of that normal force back onto the scale  

the scale measures that force, and can calculate apparent weight with F = ma  

# Mar. 21, 2025 - Acceleration Near the Earth's Surface

**force field** - a region of space surrounding an object that can exert a force on other objects that are placed within
that region and are able to interact with that force  
**gravitational field strength (GFS)** - the force per unit mass acting on an object when placed in a gravitational field  

mass stays constant, whereas weight is dependant on the GFS  
mass is measured in **kg**, weight is measured in **N**  

mass is measured with a balance scale that compares the reading with known masses  
weight is measured using a normal scale that measures the reaction force of the normal force of the object  

# Mar. 25, 2025 - Friction

**static friction** - a force of friction that prevents the sliding of two surfaces relative to one another  
**kinetic friction** - the force exerted on a moving object by a surface opposite to the direction of motion of the object  

static friction is when an object **is at rest**, kinetic friciton is whilst the object **is in motion**  

as applied force increases, static friction increases **linearly** until the **maximum static friction**  
once the object begins to move, the static friction **decreases** then remains **relatively constant**  

**the area of contact between the two surfaces does *not* affect the frictional force**  

**dynamic friction (kinetic friction)** (F\_d) = μ\_d \* F\_n (normal force)  
μ\_d is the **coefficient of dynamic friction**  
each pair of materials has a different coefficient  

**maximum force of static friction** (F\_s) = μ\_s \* F\_n  
however, F\_s can be less than μ\_s \* F\_n if the applied force does not reach the maximum static friction
(recall the linear relationship between applied force and static friction)  

# Mar. 26, 2025

## Problem Solving
- draw as many free body diagram as required, all with a frame of reference  
- tension force is the same on both sides of the string  
- equates two F\_net statements  

## Springs
springs will always try to restore itself to its original length  
in the spring equation, **x is the distance the spring is from the equilibrium position**  

there is an **spring force** that makes the spring want to return to its original length  
**note: when an object is dangling off a spring, since the net force is 0, the spring force = force of gravity**  

**Hooke's law is F = kx, where k is the *spring constant***  
the relationship of force and distance is **linear** as shown in the equation  
**k** may be shown as negative as the force is in the opposite direction  

k is in units of **newtons / meter**  

# Mar. 28, 2025 - Newtonian Gravitation

there is a gravitational attraction between **any two objects**
F\_g = G \* m1 \* m2 / r^2  

G = 6.673 \* 10^-11 N \* m^2 / kg^2  

where m is the masses of the two objects  
r is the distance separating the two **centres of the objects**  

thus, force of gravitational attraction is proportional to mass and inversely proportional to distance  

by newton's third law, you pull on Earth with the equal force Earth pulls you on  

the force is **only noticeable if one object is very large (e.g. the Earth)**  

# Apr. 2, 2025 - Uncertainties

**note: this is only for physics; chemistry is different**  

suppose a ruler with 1/10 cm increments  
uncertainty would then be 0.05 cm  

final reading would be xx.x5 +/- 0.05 cm  

**uncertainty normally has one significant figure**  
uncertainty is calculated with **(max - min) / *2*** (**differs from chemistry**)   

**final answer then is rounded to the number of decimal digits in the uncertainty**  

systematic errors **bias the measurement in the same direction**  
(consistently produce too large or too small of a measurement)  

if a term is raised to the power of an exponent *n*, the uncertainty becomes **|n| \* relative uncertainty**  

when multiplying measurements, **add the relative uncertainty**  
when adding measurements, **add the absolute uncertainty**  

when multiply a measurement by a constant, **multiply the absolute uncertainty by the constant as well** (this **differs from chemistry**)  

# Apr. 3, 2025 - Work

work is **the transfer of energy**  

work is a **scalar quantity**, it has no direction  
the unit for work is the **Joule (J)**  
the derived units are **N \* m**  

the formula for work is **W = F \* d \* cos(θ)**  
(assumes force is **constant**)  
as such, if there is a force, but no displacement, the **net work done on the object is 0**  

on a F-d graph, work is the area under the curve (**its antiderivative**)  

**cos(θ) is used to find the force vector relative to the displacement**; since the perpendicular component is not displacing the object
since the force applied is as the "front" of the object, so it will never displace the object perpendicularly, even if the perpendicular component
is greater than the gravity of force  

assuming friction and an applied force, the work done by the applied force is **F_a \* d \* cos(θ)**  
however, the **net work** is **(F_a - F_fr) \* d \* cos(θ)**  

positive work leads to an increase in speed of an object (**increase** in kinetic energy)  
negative work leads to a decrease in speed of an object (**decrease** in kinetic energy)  

since F is proportional to acceleration, this holds as constant force is assumed  

# Apr. 7, 2025 - Energy 

**energy** - the ability to do **work on another object**  

**kinetic energy** - the energy possessed by moving objects by virtue of its speed  
E\_k = (m \* v^2) / 2  

as such, all moving objects have the ability to do work, i.e., they have energy  

it is a **scalar quantity**  
v is usually the **final velocity**  
the unit is a **joule (j)**  

**work-energy principle: the net mechanical work done on an object equals the object's change in kinetic energy**  
W\_net = ΔE\_k  

**potential energy** - a form of energy an object possesses because of its position in relation to force in its environment
(ex: elastic potential energy - rubber band)  

**gravitational potential energy** - energy possessed by an object by virtue of its position **relative to the surface of the Earth**  
must always consider a **reference level**  

E\_g = m \* g \* Δh  

h is the **height above a chosen reference level**  
also measured in **joules (J)**  

# Apr. 8, 2025 - Power

**law of conservation of mechanical energy - no energy can be created or destroyed; it can only be transformed**  
(ex: going up the stairs => increase of potential energy from kinetic energy => kinetic energy comes from chemical potential energy
(from food) => from thermal energy => from sun => etc.)  

**power** - **the rate at which energy is transformed or the rate at which work is done**  
(the **derivative of work**)  

as such, **P = ΔE / Δt**  
or, **P = W_net / Δt**  

the unit is the **watt (W), the derived units are J/s**  

since W = F \* d \* cos(θ), **P = F \* cos(θ) \* v (velocity)** as well  

# Apr. 9, 2025 - Mechanical Energy

**mechanical energy (E_t) - the sum of kinetic and gravitational potential energy at a certain point**  
thus, E\_t = E\_k + E\_g  
thus, E\_t = (mv^2) / 2 + mgh  

due to the law of conservation of mechanical energy, in a closed mechanical system, **total energy at one point = total energy at another point**  

# Apr. 11, 2025 - Efficiency

**efficiency = E_out / E_in \* 100%** (same formula as percentage yield in chemistry)  

# Apr. 14, 2025 - Total Mechanical Energy

graphing the spring force against the distance traveled by the spring allows for the work done to be found
by finding the area **under the curve**  

**note: spring energy may be referred to as elastic energy**  
**note: this graph will be a linear relationship, as the y-axis has been substituted for kx, a linear function**    

as such **W = 0.5 \* k \* ((x_2)^2 - (x_1)^2)**  
where x\_2 is the final position of the spring and x\_1 the initial  

thus **total mechanical energy = kinetic + potential + spring energy**  
(and work done by friction if applicable)  

# Apr. 16, 2025 - Heat Capacity

**thermal energy** - the **total** kinetic and potential energy of an object at the molecular or atomic level  
thus, gases normally have more thermal energy than solids  

**temperature** - indicates the **average kinetic energy** in a given volume  

**heat** - the amount of energy **transferred** from a warmer to a cooler object  
denoted by ΔE\_h or Q  

units are either **joule (J) or calories**  
**1 calorie = 4.1841 J**  

**specific heat capacity (c)** - amoutn of heat that a kilogram of substance can gain or lose in order ot change its **temperature**
by one degree  
units are **J / (kg \* C)** (note that the mass is in kg not g like in chemistry)  

therefore, all heat capacities are 1000 times larger in physics  
ex: c\_water = 4180 J / (kg \* C)  

Q = mcΔT (same as chemistry except m is measured in kg in physics)  

## The Principle of Thermal Energy Exchange
**thermal equilibrium** - no more thermal energy flows between two objects  
thus, at thermal equilibrium, the two objects are at the same **temperature**  

by the law of the conservation of energy, total amount of **thermal energy** must be constant so long as none of it is lost to its surroundings  
thus, **Q_released + Q_absorbed = 0**  

# Apr. 17, 2025 

## Calorimetry
used to solve for heat capacity in certain solids  

## States of Matter and Changes of State
internal energy = thermal energy  

while a matter is changing state, thermal energy absorbed increases, but temperature does not as inter-molecular bonds are being broken
to allow the change in state  

**latent heat** - the amount of thermal energy absorbed or released when a substance changes states and **does not change the temperature**  
**released** during condensation and freezing  
**stored** when thermal energy is added during melting and vapourization  

latent means "hidden"  

two types of latent heat:  
- latent heat of fusion  
- latent heat of vapourization  

fusion: the amount of thermal energy needed to **melt or freeze** 1 kg of a substance  
thus, more mass => more energy  
**L_f = E_h / m**  
or **Q = L_f \* m**  
L\_f is a constant in **J / kg**  

vapourization: thermal energy needed to **evaporate or condense** 1 kg of a substance  
same formula, just different constant (latent heat of vapourization)  

# Apr. 25, 2025 - Nuclear Physics

**nucleon** = proton + neutron  

charge of a nucleus equals **number of protons \* e**  
e is the elementary charge = 1.6 \* 10 ^ -19 C (coulomb)  

alpha particles are the same as **helium**  
notation for nucleon number / proton number can be applied to other particles (e.g. neutrinos, alpha particles, photons, protons, positrons, etc.)  

**isotopes** - same number of protons, but different neutron number  
identical chemical properties but different physical properties  

an unstable nucleus is one that randomly emits particles that carry **energy away from the nucleus (radioactivity)**  

all types of decay have a **conservation of electric charge and mass**  
(nucleon numbers of products and proton number of products should add up to the reactant's)  

## Types of Decay
3 types:  
- alpha (original nucleus turns into other nucleus + alpha particle (helium))  
the new chemical is called the **daughter atom**, and the original is called the **parent atom**  

- beta 
**beta minus decay** - neutron in decaying nucleus turns into a proton, emitting an **electron and an anti-neutrino**  
beta-minus particle = **electron**  

a bar on top of the variable means it is the **anti-particle**  

**beta positive decay** - emits a **positron and a neutrino (denoted with the letter *v*)**  
=> **beta positive particle** = **positron**  

- gamma  
emits a **gamma ray**, a photon (denoted with **gamma**) with high-frequency electromagnetic radiation  

## Radioactive Decay
**radioactive decay is spontaneous and random, and may undergo multiple types of decay to become stable**  

**law of radioactive decay** -
the number of nuclei that will decay per second is **proportional to the number of nuclei in the sample that have not yet decayed**  
ΔN / Δt ∝ N  

**half-life** - the time it takes for the number of radioative nuclei to be reduced by a factor of 2  
A = A\_0 \* (1/2) ^ (t / h)  

A\_0 is the initial amount of the sample  
h is the **half-life (in seconds)**  

**activity** - the number of decays per second, measured by the **becquerel (bq), which is 1 decay per second**  

## Fundamental Forces
**4 fundamental fources**  
- electromagnetic - acts on any particle with an electric charge, given by **Coulomb's law**  
has **infinite range**  
- weak nuclear interaction - acts on **protons, neutrons, electrons, and neutrinos** in order to cause beta decay  
short range of 10^-18 meters  
- strong nuclear interaction - mainly **attractive force** between protons and neutrons to keep them bound to each other inside the nucleus  
has a short range of 10^-15 meters  
- gravitational interaction - force of attraction between masses; is irrelevant in atomic particles due to extremely small masses  
has an infinite range  

# Apr. 28, 2025 - Mass Defect and Binding Energy

atomic mass unit (**amu / u**) - 1/12 the mass of an atom of carbon-12  
1 u = 1.66 \* 10^-27 **kg** (note the unit; it is not grams like in chemistry)  

energy is released when nucleons are brought together to form a nucleus, equivalent to a loss of mass  
**mass of nucleons is greater when far paart than mass of nucleus**  

E = mc^2  

**note: 1 amu = 931.5 MeV / c^2**  
(refer to nuclear physics images for the derivation)  

the mass of the protons plus the mass of the neutrons is larger than the mass of the nucleus  
this is the **mass defect (δ)**  

δ = mass of nucleons - mass of nucleus  
δ = (number of protons \* mass of proton (amu)) + (nucleon number - atomic number) \* (mass of neutron) - (mass of nucleus)  

**note: nucleon number - atomic number = number of neutrons**  

**the binding energy of a nucleus is the energy required to completely separate the nucleons of that nucleus**  
binding energy = δc^2  

1 eV (electron-volt) = 1.602 \* 10^-19 J  

MeV (mega electron-volt) = 10^6 eV  

## Nuclear Fission
heavy nucleus => lighter nuclei  

when a neutron is absorbed by uranium-235, it turns into u-236, which then splits into lighter nuclei + neutrons  
these neutrons can then be absorbed by other u-235, creating a **chain reaction**  

thus, a certain amount of u-235 must already be present, the **critical mass**  

recall: E = mc^2  
subtract LHS mass from RHS mass => negative mass  
=> negative energy, an exothermic reaction => energy is **released**  

this energy appears as **kinetic energy in the products**  

this process is an **induced process**, i.e., a neutron must be shot into the u-235  
spontaneous fission, i.e., a nucleus splitting without neutron absorption, is possible for some heavy elements but rare  

## Nuclear Fusion
two lighter nuclei => heavier one + energy  

deuterium + deterium -> helium-3 + neutron  

find the change in mass, and use E = Δmc^2 to find the energy released  

after fusion and fission, the products are more stable than the reactants (they have a higher **average binding energy per nucleon**)  
the difference in energy between products and reactants is the energy emitted; this energy is emitted through a loss in mass (the **mass defect**)  

# Apr. 29, 2025 - Electricity and Its Production

**static electricity** - an imbalance of electric charge on the **surface** of an object  
**current electricity** - charge (electrons) flow  

**electric current** - electrons flow *freely* through a conductor to **transfer their energy (the ability to do work)**  
**current** - the number of charges moving through **a point** every **second**  

as such, I = Q/Δt  

I is **current** in **amperes** (A)  

Q is the amount of charge in **coulombs** (C)  
1 C = **6.2 * 10^18 electrons**  

1 A = **1 C/s  (one coulomb per second)**  

Δt is the time in seconds  

two types of current flow:  
- direct current (DC): movement of electrons in **one direction**  
- alternating current (AC): electrons move **back and forth in *different* directions**  

**conventional current flow** - positive charges flow from positive to negative terminal of energy source  
**electron current flow** - negative charges flow from the negative to the positive terminal of the energy source  

**electrical power** - the **rate** at which electrical energy is **produced or consumed or transformed** in a given time  

P = ΔE / Δt  
(same formula as in the energy unit)  

## Apr. 30, 2025 - Electric Potential Energy

since electrons repel one another, energy must be transferred to overcome this force and to keep electrons close together  
this increases the electrons' **electric potential energy**  

therefore, the movement of electrons require a change in energy  

**electric potential** - the amount of **electric potential energy** associated with a charge (an electron)  

electric potential measures the amount of **electrical energy and the quantity of electrons**  
thus, the unit is Joule / Coulomb (recall, a coulomb is just a number of electrons)  
the J/C is known as the **volt (V)**  

it is often more useful to measure the **change in electric potential between two points in a circuit**  
this is the **electric potential difference, or *voltage***  

V = ΔE/Q  

V = electrical potential difference (in volts)  
ΔE = change in electric potential energy (in joules)  
Q = amount of charge (electrons, measured in **coulombs**)  

a **voltmeter** measure the electrical potential difference  
it is only accurate when connected in **parallel with the circuit**
