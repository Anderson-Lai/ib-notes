# Feb. 4, 2025 - Significant Figures

when taking a measurement, the number contains all the certain digits of the measurement + one more figure that is guessed, the **uncertain** digit  
this is used **in place of** +/- like in chemistry  

exponent of the scientific notation does not count towards significant figures  

# Feb. 5, 2025 - Introduction to Kinematics

types of quantities:  
**scalar** - specified by a value (**magnitude**) only; no direction (e.g. mass, time, distance, energy)  
**vector** - specificed by **magnitude** and **direction** (e.g. position, velocity, weight)  

vector notation has arrow on top of variable name  
also has a square brackets beside it indicating the **direction**  

when stating position X is relative to position Y the answer **must** have a **direction** (e.g. 5 metres east)  

**displacement** - measures change in **position**  

**distance** is a **scalar** quantity  

**position** - distance and direction of an object with respect to (w.r.t) a reference point; 
no motion is needed to state position => **vector quantity**  
positio is denoted by the letter **d** (with an arrow on top)  

**displacement** - a change in position, regardless of how it got there; motion is necessary; has magnitude and direction => **vector quantity**  

both position and displacement **have a point of reference**  

distance is a measure of the interval between two locations along the actual path  
as such, distance is **never negative**  

displacement is the measure of the interval between two locations along the **shortest path** connecting them  
displacement **can** be negative as there is a **point of reference**  

Δd = d\_f - d\_i  
(assume there are arrows on top of each *d*)  

## Speed vs Velocity
**speed** = total distance / total time  
**velocity** = total **displacement** / total time  

veloctiy is a **vector quantity** => arrow over variable  

## Interpreting Negatives
by convention:  
- north and east are positive; south and west are negative  
- up and right are positive; down and left are negative  

however, which direction is positive or negative can be defined by using a **frame of reference**  

cartesian coordinate system is used when dealing with vectors  

## Reading d-t Graph
**slope** of the line gives the relative speed / velocity  

**straight line** - uniform / constant speed  
**curved line** - non-uniform speed / acceleration  

**acceleration** - the rate at which an object changes in **speed or velocity w.r.t time**  

## Instantaneous Velocity
derivative of position  
slope of the **tangent line**  

## Average Velocity 
slope of the **secant line**  

# Feb. 6, 2025

## Velocity-Time Graphs
to determine if an object is accelerating, take the **absolute value of the magnitude**  
negative sign only gives the **direction** as velocity is a vector quantity  
|v(t)|  

the object is at **rest at the zeroes of the function**  
v(t) = 0

the total displacement is the **area under the curve** for the given interval of time  
∫t1,t2 v(t) dt

average velocity is the **area under the curve for the total time period / total time**  
∫t1,t2 v(t) dt / (t2 - t1)  

## Acceleration
acceleration = Δv / Δt (acceleration has an arrow over it as it is a **vector quantity**)  
**note: d/dt p(t) = v(t); d/dt v(t) = a(t)**  

**decelerate does not mean negative acceleration, just a reduction in velocity**  

# Feb. 10, 2025

for a v-t graph, area under the curve = displacement  
remember to have curved lines for constant velocity  

# Feb. 18, 2025

when objects are in free fall, only **gravity** acts on the object (ignore air resistance)  
all objects experience approximately the same acceleration due to gravity  

common example of **constant acceleration** => all 5 kinematic equations can be used  

**g = -9.80 m/s^2**  
note the negative sign  
or **9.8 m/s^2 [d]**  

# Feb. 21, 2025 - Motion In 2D

when given a direction say [N 30° E], it means start at **north and turn a heading of 30° to east**  

ex: [N 50° W] = final heading of 310°  

to add two vectors graphically, add the two magnitudes together  
then connect the **tail of the first vector to the tip of the second vector**  

the final vector is between those two points with a magnitude of the two magnitudes added together  

the **negative of a vector** is a vector with the same magnitude but points in the opposite direction  
therefore, v2 - v1 is the same as v2 + (-v1)  

# Feb. 24, 2025 - Algebraic Approach To Vectors

a vector can be broken down to a **x and y component**  

calculate the x component and y component of each vector using sine/cosine  

add up the different components in each vector  
use the pythagorean theorem on the summed components to calculate the **magnitude** of the final vector  

with the summed components, tangent can be used to find the **direction of the vector**  

ensure the final answer is positive  
ensure the direction is correct  

# Feb. 25, 2025 - Projectile Motion (Pt. 1)

any **object** given an **initial thrust** and then alowed to **soar through the air** under the influence
of **gravity only** is called a **projectile**  

after the projectile is launched, only gravity is acting on it => all objects accelerates downward at 9.8 m/s^2  
there is **no horizontal acceleration** (a\_x = 0; a\_y = -9.8 m/s^2)  
as such, **v1 = v2**  

air resistance *does* have an effect, but it is too complex to calculate, and thus will be ignored  

**horizontal and vertical motion** are analyzed **separately** as they are **independent**  

angle of the projectile's launch affects the **range (horizontal displacement)**  

# Feb. 26, 2025 - Projectile Motion

if the object lands at the same height it was thrown, Δd\_y = 0  
max height is when v\_y = 0  

**always draw a frame of reference, even if there is no diagram**  

example of final velocity:  
42 m/s [R 32° D]  

use **time** to relate the y component and x component of the projectile  

# Mar. 4, 2025 - Dynamics / Forces

**force** - anything that causes an object to change in **velocity**, i.e., **accelerate**  
**not** required to keep an object moving  

a force is a **push or a pull**  
two types of forces:  
- contact forces - arise from physical contact  
- action-at-a-distance forces - do not require contact  
ex: gravity, electrical forces, magnetic forces  

force is a **vector quantity**  
measured in **newtons (N)**  
force is measured with a **newton's spring scale**  

most common types of forces:  
- applied force (F\_a) - one object contacts another object and **pushes/pulls** on the object  
- tension force (F\_t) - pulling force from a rope or string on an object that **always points toward the rope or string**  
- normal force (F\_n *or* W) - a **perpendicular** force exerted by a **surface** on an object that is in contact with the surface  
always points **away from the surface** (keeps you from falling through the floor)  
- force of friction (F\_fr) - a force that opposes the sliding of two surfaces across one another  
is always **parallel to the surface**; is always the **opposite direction of the object's motion**  
- force of gravity (F\_g) - the force of **attraction between *all* objects**  
force of gravity between Earth and objects at/near the Earth's surface is directed **toward the Earth's surface**  
is an example of an *action-at-a-distance* force => contact is not needed  
force of gravity is **proportional to mass**  

F\_g = m \* g  
m = mass  
g = acceleration due to gravity  

**mass** - the measure of the amount of matter ("stuff") contained in an object  
mass **always remains constant**  

however, **weight** is *not* constant  
it is dependant on the gravitional pull of the planet  

whenever a spring is compressed / extended
a spring will develop a tension force inside the spring that will bring the length **back to its original value**  

**drag forces** - similar to friction forces; opposes acceleration  
ex: air resistance  

**upthrust force** - any object in a fluid experiences this force  
caused by the **pressure the fluid exerts on the body**  
if upthrust = weight => object will float  

## Free Body Diagrams
used to show **all** forces acting on an object  
include a frame of references  
all forces point **away** from the object  
only include forces acting **directly on** the object  
**not** drawn to scale  

to keep an object at a **constant velocity**, there **must** be an applied force (F\_a) in order to oppose **friction / drag forces**  

**net force** (F\_net) - vector sum of all the forces acting on an object  
separate the **horizontal and veritcal directions**  

when F\_net = 0, the object is said to be in **translational equilibrium**  
ex: the object is at rest or the object is at a constant velocity (F\_a = F\_fr + F\_d)  

# Mar. 6, 2025 - Newton's Laws

**inertia** - the property of matter that causes a body to **resist a change** in its state of motion  
**mass is proportional to inertia**  

**first law of motion** - if the net external force on an object is zero, the object will remain at rest or continue to move at a constant velocity  

**net force being 0 leads to a object staying at rest or at a constant velocity**  

**second law of motion** - an **unbalanced** force acting on an object causes the object to **accelerate**  
F\_net = ma  

# Mar. 18, 2025 - Newton's Third Law

for every **action force** there is an equal and opposite **reaction force**  
**forces always act in pairs on *different objects***  

normal force and gravity are *not* an example of newton's third law  

# Mar. 20, 2025 - Elevator Problems

when calculating the **apparent weight** of someone on a scale in an elevator, find the normal force acting on the person  
by newton's third law, there is an equal and opposite reaction of that normal force back onto the scale  

the scale measures that force, and can calculate apparent weight with F = ma  

# Mar. 21, 2025 - Acceleration Near the Earth's Surface

**force field** - a region of space surrounding an object that can exert a force on other objects that are placed within
that region and are able to interact with that force  
**gravitational field strength (GFS)** - the force per unit mass acting on an object when placed in a gravitational field  

mass stays constant, whereas weight is dependant on the GFS  
mass is measured in **kg**, weight is measured in **N**  

mass is measured with a balance scale that compares the reading with known masses  
weight is measured using a normal scale that measures the reaction force of the normal force of the object  

# Mar. 25, 2025 - Friction

**static friction** - a force of friction that prevents the sliding of two surfaces relative to one another  
**kinetic friction** - the force exerted on a moving object by a surface opposite to the direction of motion of the object  

static friction is when an object **is at rest**, kinetic friciton is whilst the object **is in motion**  

as applied force increases, static friction increases **linearly** until the **maximum static friction**  
once the object begins to move, the static friction **decreases** then remains **relatively constant**  

**the area of contact between the two surfaces does *not* affect the frictional force**  

**dynamic friction (kinetic friction)** (F\_d) = μ\_d \* F\_n (normal force)  
μ\_d is the **coefficient of dynamic friction**  
each pair of materials has a different coefficient  

**maximum force of static friction** (F\_s) = μ\_s \* F\_n  
however, F\_s can be less than μ\_s \* F\_n if the applied force does not reach the maximum static friction
(recall the linear relationship between applied force and static friction)  

# Mar. 26, 2025

## Problem Solving
- draw as many free body diagram as required, all with a frame of reference  
- tension force is the same on both sides of the string  
- equates two F\_net statements  

## Springs
springs will always try to restore itself to its original length  
in the spring equation, **x is the distance the spring is from the equilibrium position**  

there is an **spring force** that makes the spring want to return to its original length  
**note: when an object is dangling off a spring, since the net force is 0, the spring force = force of gravity**  

**Hooke's law is F = kx, where k is the *spring constant***  
the relationship of force and distance is **linear** as shown in the equation  
**k** may be shown as negative as the force is in the opposite direction  

k is in units of **newtons / meter**  

# Mar. 28, 2025 - Newtonian Gravitation

there is a gravitational attraction between **any two objects**
F\_g = G \* m1 \* m2 / r^2  

G = 6.673 \* 10^-11 N \* m^2 / kg^2  

where m is the masses of the two objects  
r is the distance separating the two **centres of the objects**  

thus, force of gravitational attraction is proportional to mass and inversely proportional to distance  

by newton's third law, you pull on Earth with the equal force Earth pulls you on  

the force is **only noticeable if one object is very large (e.g. the Earth)**  

# Apr. 2, 2025 - Uncertainties

**note: this is only for physics; chemistry is different**  

suppose a ruler with 1/10 cm increments  
uncertainty would then be 0.05 cm  

final reading would be xx.x5 +/- 0.05 cm  


**uncertainty normally has one significant figure**  
uncertainty is calculated with **(max - min) / *2***  

**final answer then is rounded to the number of decimal digits in the uncertainty**  

systematic errors **bias the measurement in the same direction**  
(consistently produce too large or too small of a measurement)  

if a term is raised to the power of an exponent *n*, the uncertainty becomes **|n| \* relative uncertainty**  

# Apr. 3, 2025 - Work

work is a **scalar quantity**, it has no direction  
the unit for work is the **Joule (J)**  
the derived units are **N \* m**  

the formula for work is **W = F \* d \* cos(θ)**  
as such, if there is a force, but no displacement, the **net work done on the object is 0**  

**cos(θ) is used to find the horizontal component of the force**, since the vertical component is not displacing the object
since the force applied is as the "front" of the object, so it will never displace the object vertically, even if the vertical component
is greater than the gravity of force  

assuming friction and an applied force, the work done by the applied force is **F_a \* d \* cos(θ)**  
however, the **net work** is **(F_a - F_fr) \* d \* cos(θ)**
