# Feb. 4, 2025 - Significant Figures

when taking a measurement, the number contains all the certain digits of the measurement + one more figure that is guessed, the **uncertain** digit  
this is used **in place of** +/- like in chemistry  

exponent of the scientific notation does not count towards significant figures  

# Feb. 5, 2025 - Introduction to Kinematics

types of quantities:  
**scalar** - specified by a value (**magnitude**) only; no direction (e.g. mass, time, distance, energy)  
**vector** - specificed by **magnitude** and **direction** (e.g. position, velocity, weight)  

vector notation has arrow on top of variable name  
also has a square brackets beside it indicating the **direction**  

when stating position X is relative to position Y the answer **must** have a **direction** (e.g. 5 metres east)  

**displacement** - measures change in **position**  

**distance** is a **scalar** quantity  

**position** - distance and direction of an object with respect to (w.r.t) a reference point; 
no motion is needed to state position => **vector quantity**  
positio is denoted by the letter **d** (with an arrow on top)  

**displacement** - a change in position, regardless of how it got there; motion is necessary; has magnitude and direction => **vector quantity**  

both position and displacement **have a point of reference**  

distance is a measure of the interval between two locations along the actual path  
as such, distance is **never negative**  

displacement is the measure of the interval between two locations along the **shortest path** connecting them  
displacement **can** be negative as there is a **point of reference**  

Δd = d\_f - d\_i  
(assume there are arrows on top of each *d*)  

## Speed vs Velocity
**speed** = total distance / total time  
**velocity** = total **displacement** / total time  

veloctiy is a **vector quantity** => arrow over variable  

## Interpreting Negatives
by convention:  
- north and east are positive; south and west are negative  
- up and right are positive; down and left are negative  

however, which direction is positive or negative can be defined by using a **frame of reference**  

cartesian coordinate system is used when dealing with vectors  

## Reading d-t Graph
**slope** of the line gives the relative speed / velocity  

**straight line** - uniform / constant speed  
**curved line** - non-uniform speed / acceleration  

**acceleration** - the rate at which an object changes in **speed or velocity w.r.t time**  

## Instantaneous Velocity
derivative of position  
slope of the **tangent line**  

## Average Velocity 
slope of the **secant line**  

# Feb. 6, 2025

## Velocity-Time Graphs
to determine if an object is accelerating, take the **absolute value of the magnitude**  
negative sign only gives the **direction** as velocity is a vector quantity  
|v(t)|  

the object is at **rest at the zeroes of the function**  
v(t) = 0

the total displacement is the **area under the curve** for the given interval of time  
∫t1,t2 v(t) dt

average velocity is the **area under the curve for the total time period / total time**  
∫t1,t2 v(t) dt / (t2 - t1)  

## Acceleration
acceleration = Δv / Δt (acceleration has an arrow over it as it is a **vector quantity**)  
**note: d/dt p(t) = v(t); d/dt v(t) = a(t)**  

**decelerate does not mean negative acceleration, just a reduction in velocity**  

# Feb. 10, 2025

for a v-t graph, area under the curve = displacement  
remember to have curved lines for constant velocity  

# Feb. 18, 2025

when objects are in free fall, only **gravity** acts on the object (ignore air resistance)  
all objects experience approximately the same acceleration due to gravity  

common example of **constant acceleration** => all 5 kinematic equations can be used  

**g = -9.80 m/s^2**  
note the negative sign  
or **9.8 m/s^2 [d]**  

# Feb. 21, 2025 - Motion In 2D

when given a direction say [N 30° E], it means start at **north and turn a heading of 30° to east**  

ex: [N 50° W] = final heading of 310°  

to add two vectors graphically, add the two magnitudes together  
then connect the **tail of the first vector to the tip of the second vector**  

the final vector is between those two points with a magnitude of the two magnitudes added together  

the **negative of a vector** is a vector with the same magnitude but points in the opposite direction  
therefore, v2 - v1 is the same as v2 + (-v1)  

# Feb. 24, 2025 - Algebraic Approach To Vectors

a vector can be broken down to a **x and y component**  

calculate the x component and y component of each vector using sine/cosine  

add up the different components in each vector  
use the pythagorean theorem on the summed components to calculate the **magnitude** of the final vector  

with the summed components, tangent can be used to find the **direction of the vector**  

ensure the final answer is positive  
ensure the direction is correct  

# Feb. 25, 2025 - Projectile Motion (Pt. 1)

any **object** given an **initial thrust** and then alowed to **soar through the air** under the influence
of **gravity only** is called a **projectile**  

after the projectile is launched, only gravity is acting on it => all objects accelerates downward at 9.8 m/s^2  
there is **no horizontal acceleration** (a\_x = 0; a\_y = -9.8 m/s^2)  
as such, **v1 = v2**  

air resistance *does* have an effect, but it is too complex to calculate, and thus will be ignored  

**horizontal and vertical motion** are analyzed **separately** as they are **independent**  

angle of the projectile's launch affects the **range (horizontal displacement)**  

# Feb. 26, 2025 - Projectile Motion

if the object lands at the same height it was thrown, Δd\_y = 0  
max height is when v\_y = 0  

**always draw a frame of reference, even if there is no diagram**  

example of final velocity:  
42 m/s [R 32° D]  

use **time** to relate the y component and x component of the projectile  

# Mar. 4, 2025 - Dynamics / Forces

**force** - anything that causes an object to change in **velocity**, i.e., **accelerate**  
**not** required to keep an object moving  

a force is a **push or a pull**  
two types of forces:  
- contact forces - arise from physical contact  
- action-at-a-distance forces - do not require contact  
ex: gravity, electrical forces, magnetic forces  

force is a **vector quantity**  
measured in **newtons (N)**  
force is measured with a **newton's spring scale**  

most common types of forces:  
- applied force (F\_a) - one object contacts another object and **pushes/pulls** on the object  
- tension force (F\_t) - pulling force from a rope or string on an object that **always points toward the rope or string**  
- normal force (F\_n *or* W) - a **perpendicular** force exerted by a **surface** on an object that is in contact with the surface  
always points **away from the surface** (keeps you from falling through the floor)  
- force of friction (F\_fr) - a force that opposes the sliding of two surfaces across one another  
is always **parallel to the surface**; is always the **opposite direction of the object's motion**  
- force of gravity (F\_g) - the force of **attraction between *all* objects**  
force of gravity between Earth and objects at/near the Earth's surface is directed **toward the Earth's surface**  
is an example of an *action-at-a-distance* force => contact is not needed  
force of gravity is **proportional to mass**  

F\_g = m \* g  
m = mass  
g = acceleration due to gravity  

**mass** - the measure of the amount of matter ("stuff") contained in an object  
mass **always remains constant**  

however, **weight** is *not* constant  
it is dependant on the gravitional pull of the planet  

whenever a spring is compressed / extended
a spring will develop a tension force inside the spring that will bring the length **back to its original value**  

**drag forces** - similar to friction forces; opposes acceleration  
ex: air resistance  

**upthrust force** - any object in a fluid experiences this force  
caused by the **pressure the fluid exerts on the body**  
if upthrust = weight => object will float  

## Free Body Diagrams
used to show **all** forces acting on an object  
include a frame of references  
all forces point **away** from the object  
only include forces acting **directly on** the object  
**not** drawn to scale  

to keep an object at a **constant velocity**, there **must** be an applied force (F\_a) in order to oppose **friction / drag forces**  

**net force** (F\_net) - vector sum of all the forces acting on an object  
separate the **horizontal and veritcal directions**  

when F\_net = 0, the object is said to be in **translational equilibrium**  
ex: the object is at rest or the object is at a constant velocity (F\_a = F\_fr + F\_d)  

# Mar. 6, 2025 - Newton's Laws

**inertia** - the property of matter that causes a body to **resist a change** in its state of motion  
**mass is proportional to inertia**  

**first law of motion** - if the net external force on an object is zero, the object will remain at rest or continue to move at a constant velocity  

**net force being 0 leads to a object staying at rest or at a constant velocity**  

**second law of motion** - an **unbalanced** force acting on an object causes the object to **accelerate**  
F\_net = ma  

# Mar. 18, 2025 - Newton's Third Law

for every **action force** there is an equal and opposite **reaction force**  
**forces always act in pairs on *different objects***  

normal force and gravity are *not* an example of newton's third law
